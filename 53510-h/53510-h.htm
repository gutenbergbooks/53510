<p>This Sketch has already appeared in the eleventh
volume of the Asiatic Researches: but, as that valuable
work is not in common circulation, it is now
republished; and may prove acceptable, as a short and
clear account of an oriental people, of singular religion
and manners, with whose history the European reader
can be but little acquainted.</p>

<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>


<p>When with the British army in the
Penjáb, in 1805, I endeavoured to collect
materials that would throw light upon the
history, manners, and religion of the Sikhs.
Though this subject had been treated by
several English writers, none of them had
possessed opportunities of obtaining more
than very general information regarding
this extraordinary race; and their narratives
therefore, though meriting regard,
have served more to excite than to gratify
curiosity.</p>

<p>In addition to the information I collected
while the army continued within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
territories of the Sikhs, and the personal
observations I was able to make, during
that period, upon the customs and manners
of that nation, I succeeded with difficulty
in obtaining a copy of the Adí-Grant'h<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>,
and of some historical tracts, the most
essential parts of which, when I returned
to Calcutta, were explained to me by a
Sikh priest of the Nirmala order, whom I
found equally intelligent and communicative,
and who spoke of the religion and
ceremonies of his sect with less restraint
than any of his brethren whom I had met
with in the Penjáb. This slender stock
of materials was subsequently much enriched
by my friend Dr. Leyden, who has
favoured me with a translation of several
tracts written by Sikh authors in the Penjábí
and Dúggar dialects, treating of their
history and religion; which, though full of
that warm imagery which marks all oriental
works, and particularly those whose authors
enter on the boundless field of Hindú mythology,
contain the most valuable verifications
of the different religious institutions
of the Sikh nation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>
<p>It was my first intention to have endeavoured
to add to these materials, and to
have written, when I had leisure, a history
of the Sikhs; but the active nature of my
public duties has made it impossible to
carry this plan into early execution, and
I have had the choice of deferring it to
a distant and uncertain period; or of giving,
from what I actually possessed, a short
and hasty sketch of their history, customs,
and religion. The latter alternative I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
adopted: for, although the information I
may convey in such a sketch may be very
defective, it will be useful at a moment
when every information regarding the Sikhs
is of importance; and it may, perhaps, stimulate
and aid some person, who has more
leisure and better opportunities, to accomplish
that task which I once contemplated.</p>

<p>In composing this rapid sketch of the
Sikhs, I have still had to encounter various
difficulties. There is no part of oriental
biography in which it is more difficult to
separate truth from falsehood, than that
which relates to the history of religious
impostors. The account of their lives is
generally recorded, either by devoted disciples
and warm adherents, or by violent
enemies and bigotted persecutors. The former,
from enthusiastic admiration, decorate
them with every quality and accomplishment
that can adorn men: the latter misrepresent
their characters, and detract from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
all their merits and pretensions. This general
remark I have found to apply with peculiar
force to the varying accounts given, by
Sikh and Muhammedan authors, of Nánac
and his successors. As it would have been
an endless and unprofitable task to have
entered into a disquisition concerning all
the points in which these authors differ,
many considerations have induced me to
give a preference, on almost all occasions,
to the original Sikh writers. In every research
into the general history of mankind,
it is of the most essential importance to
hear what a nation has to say of itself; and
the knowledge obtained from such sources
has a value, independent of its historical
utility. It aids the promotion of social
intercourse, and leads to the establishment
of friendship between nations. The most
savage states are those who have most
prejudices, and who are consequently most
easily conciliated or offended: they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
always pleased and flattered, when they
find, that those whom they cannot but
admit to possess superior intelligence, are
acquainted with their history, and respect
their belief and usages: and, on the contrary,
they hardly ever pardon an outrage
against their religion or customs, though
committed by men who have every right to
plead the most profound ignorance, as an
excuse for the words or actions that have
provoked resentment.</p>

<h2>SECTION I.</h2>

<blockquote>

<p>SKETCH OF THE HISTORY AND PRESENT STATE
OF THE SIKHS; WITH OBSERVATIONS ON THEIR
RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS, USAGES, MANNERS,
AND CHARACTER.</p></blockquote>


<p>Nánac Sháh, the founder of the sect,
since distinguished by the name of Sikhs<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>,
was born in the year of Christ 1469, at
a small village called Talwandi<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>, in the
district of Bhatti, in the province of Lahore.
His father, whose name was Cálú<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>, was of
the Cshatríya cast, and Védí tribe of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
Hindús, and had no family except Nánac,
and his sister Nánaci, who married a Hindú
of the name of Jayarám, that was employed
as a grain-factor by Daulet Khán
Lódí, a relation of the reigning emperor of
Delhi. Nánac was, agreeably to the usage
of the tribe in which he was born, married
to a woman of respectable family, at an
early age<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>, by whom he had two sons,
named Sríchand and Lacshmí Dás. The
former, who abandoned the vanities of the
world, had a son called Dherm Chand,
who founded the sect of Udásí; and his
descendants are yet known by the name of
Nánac Putráh, or the children of Nánac.
Lacshmí Dás addicted himself to the pleasures
of this world, and left neither heirs
nor reputation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Nánac is stated, by all Sikh writers, to
have been, from his childhood, inclined to
devotion; and the indifference which this
feeling created towards all worldly concerns,
appears to have been a source of continual
uneasiness to his father; who endeavoured,
by every effort, to divert his mind from the
religious turn which it had taken. With a
view to effect this object, he one day gave
Nánac a sum of money, to purchase salt at
one village, in order to sell it at another;
in the hope of enticing him to business,
by allowing him to taste the sweets of commercial
profit. Nánac was pleased with
the scheme, took the money, and proceeded,
accompanied by a servant of the
name of Bála, of the tribe of Sand'hú,
towards the village where he was to make
his purchase. He happened, however, on
the road, to fall in with some Fakírs, (holy
mendicants,) with whom he wished to commence
a conversation; but they were so
weak, from want of victuals, which they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
had not tasted for three days, that they
could only reply to the observations of
Nánac by bending their heads, and other
civil signs of acquiescence. Nánac, affected
by their situation, said to his companion,
with emotion: "My father has
sent me to deal in salt, with a view to
profit; but the gain of this world is
unstable, and profitless; my wish is to
relieve these poor men, and to obtain
that gain which is permanent and eternal."
His companion<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> replied: "Thy
resolution is good: do not delay its execution."
Nánac immediately distributed
his money among the hungry Fakírs; who,
after they had gained strength from the
refreshment which it obtained them, entered
into a long discourse with him on the unity
of God, with which he was much delighted.
He returned next day to his father, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
demanded what profit he had made? "I
have fed the poor," said Nánac, "and
have obtained that gain for you which
will endure for ever." As the father happened
to have little value for the species of
wealth which the son had acquired, he was
enraged at having his money so fruitlessly
wasted, abused poor Nánac, and even
struck him; nor could the mild representations
of Nánací save her brother from
the violence of parental resentment. Fortune,
however, according to the Sikh narrators
of this anecdote of their teacher's
early life, had raised him a powerful protector,
who not only rescued him from
punishment, but established his fame and
respectability upon grounds that at once
put him above all fear of future bad usage
from his low-minded and sordid father.
When Nánac was quite a youth, and employed
to tend cattle in the fields, he happened
to repose himself one day under the
shade of a tree; and, as the sun declined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
towards the west, its rays fell on his face,
when a large black snake<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>, advancing to
the spot where he lay, raised itself from the
ground, and interposed its spread hood
between Nánac and the sun's rays. Ráy
Bolar<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>, the ruler of the district, was passing
the road, near the place where Nánac
slept, and marked, in silence, though not
without reflection, this unequivocal sign of
his future greatness. This chief overheard
Cálú punishing his son for his kindness
to the Fakírs. He immediately entered,
and demanded the cause of the uproar;
and, when informed of the circumstances,
he severely chid Cálú for his conduct, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
interdicted him from ever again lifting his
hand to Nánac, before whom, to the astonishment
of all present, he humbled himself
with every mark of the most profound veneration.
Though Cálú, from this event, was
obliged to treat his son with more respect
than formerly, he remained as solicitous as
ever to detach him from his religious habits,
and to fix him in some worldly occupation;
and he prevailed upon Jayrám, his son-in-law,
to admit him into partnership in his
business. Nánac, obliged to acquiesce in
these schemes, attended at the granary of
Daulet Khán Lódí, which was in charge of
Jayrám; but though his hands were employed
in this work, and his kindness of
manner made all the inhabitants of Sultánpúr,
where the granary was established, his
friends, yet his heart never strayed for one
moment from its object. It was incessantly
fixed on the Divinity; and one morning, as
he sat in a contemplative posture, a holy
Muhammedan Fakír approached, and exclaimed:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
"Oh Nánac! upon what are thy
thoughts now employed? Quit such occupations,
that thou mayest obtain the
inheritance of eternal wealth." Nánac is
said to have started up at this exclamation,
and after looking for a moment in the face
of the Fakír, he fell into a trance; from
which he had no sooner recovered, than he
immediately distributed every thing in the
granary among the poor<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>: and, after this
act, proceeded with loud shouts out of the
gates of the city, and running into a pool of
water, remained there three days; during
which some writers assert he had an interview
with the prophet Elias, termed by the
Muhammedans, Khizzer, from whom he
learnt all earthly sciences.</p>

<p>While Nánac remained in the pool,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
abstracted from all worldly considerations,
holding converse with a prophet, poor
Jayrám was put in prison by Daulet Khán
Lódí, on the charge of having dissipated
his property. Nánac, however, returned,
and told Daulet Khán that Jayrám was
faultless; that he was the object of punishment;
and that, as such, he held himself
ready to render the strictest account of all
he had lost. The Khán accepted his proposal:
Jayrám's accounts were settled;
and, to the surprise of all, a balance was
found in his favour; on which he was not
only released, but reinstated in the employment
and favour of his master. We are
told, by the Sikh authors, that these wonderful
actions increased the fame of Nánac
in a very great degree; and that he began,
from this period, to practise all the austerities
of a holy man; and, by his frequent
abstraction in the contemplation of the
divine Being, and his abstinence and virtue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
he soon acquired great celebrity through
all the countries into which he travelled.</p>

<p>There are many extravagant accounts regarding
the travels of Nánac. One author<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>,
who treats of the great reform which he
made in the worship of the true God,
which he found degraded by the idolatry
of the Hindús, and the ignorance of the
Muhammedans, relates his journey to all
the different Hindú places of pilgrimage,
and to Mecca, the holy temple of the Muhammedans.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be tedious, and foreign to the
purpose of this sketch, to accompany Nánac
in his travels, of which the above-mentioned
author, as well as others, has given
the most circumstantial accounts. He was
accompanied (agreeable to them) by a celebrated
musician, of the name of Merdaná,
and a person named Bála Sand'hú; and it
is on the tradition of the latter of these
disciples, that most of the miracles<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and
wonders of his journies are related. In
Bengal, the travellers had to encounter all
kinds of sorcerers and magicians. Poor
Merdaná, who had some of the propensities
of Sancho, and preferred warm houses and
good meals to deserts and starvation, was
constantly in trouble, and more than once
had his form changed into that of a sheep,
and of several other animals. Nánac,
however, always restored his humble friend
to the human shape, and as constantly
read him lectures on his imprudence. It
is stated, in one of those accounts, that
a Rájá of Sivanáb'hu endeavoured to tempt
Nánac, by offering him all the luxuries of
the world, to depart from his austere habits,
but in vain. His presents of rich meats,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
splendid clothes, and fair ladies, only afforded
the Sikh teacher so many opportunities
of decrying the vanities of this
world, and preaching to the Rájá the blessings
of eternal life; and he at last succeeded
in making him a convert, and resided at
Sivanáb'hu two years and five months;
during which period he composed the Prán
Sancali<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>, for the instruction of his followers.
After Nánac had visited all the
cities of India, and explained to all ranks
the great doctrines of the unity and omnipresence
of God, he went to Mecca and
Medina, where his actions, his miracles,
and his long disputations with the most
celebrated Muhammedan saints and doctors,
are most circumstantially recorded by
his biographers. He is stated, on this occasion,
to have maintained his own principles,
without offending those of others;
always professing himself the enemy of discord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
and as having no object but to reconcile
the two faiths of the Muhammedans
and Hindús in one religion; which he endeavoured
to do by recalling them to that
great and original tenet, in which they both
believed, the unity of God, and by reclaiming
them from the numerous errors into
which they had fallen. During his travels,
Nánac was introduced to the emperor
Báber<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, before whom he is said to have
defended his doctrine with great firmness
and eloquence. Báber was pleased with
him, and ordered an ample maintenance to
be bestowed upon him; which the Sikh priest
refused; observing, that he trusted in him
who provided for all men, and from whom
alone a man of virtue and religion would
consent to receive favour or reward. When
Nánac returned from his travels, he cast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
off the garments of a Fakír, and wore plain
clothes, but continued to give instructions
to his numerous disciples; and he appears,
at this period, to have experienced the
most violent opposition from the Hindú
zealots, who reproached him with having
laid aside the habits of a Fakír, and with
the impiety of the doctrines which he
taught. These accusations he treated with
great contempt; and an author, before
cited, Bhai Gúrú Dás Vali, states, that
when he visited Vatála, he enraged the
Yógíswaras<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> so much, that they tried all
their powers of enchantment to terrify him.
"Some," says this writer, "assumed the
shape of lions and tigers, others hissed
like snakes, one fell in a shower of fire,
and another tore the stars from the firmament;"
but Nánac remained tranquil:
and when required to exhibit some proof
of his powers that would astonish them, he
replied: "I have nothing to exhibit worthy
of you to behold. A holy teacher has
no defence but the purity of his doctrine:
the world may change, but the Creator
is unchangeable." These words, adds the
author, caused the miracles and enchantments
of the Yógíswaras to cease, and they
all fell at the feet of the humble Nánac,
who was protected by the all perfect God.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>Nánac, according to the same authority,
went from Vatála to Multán, where he
communed with the Pírs, or holy fathers of
the Muhammedan religion of that country.
"I am come," said he, when he entered
that province, "into a country full of Pírs,
like the sacred Gangá, visiting the ocean."
From Multán he went to Kírtipúr<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>, where
he threw off his earthly shape, and was
buried near the bank of the river Rávi,
which has since overflowed his tomb. Kírtipúr
continues a place of religious resort
and worship; and a small piece of Nánac's
garment is exhibited to pilgrims, as a sacred
relic, at his Dharmasálá, or temple.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>
<p>It would be difficult to give the character
of Nánac<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> on the authority of any account
we yet possess. His writings, especially the
first chapters of the Adí-Grant'h, will, if
ever translated, be perhaps a criterion by
which he may be fairly judged; but the
great eminence which he obtained, and the
success with which he combated the opposition
which he met, afford ample reason to
conclude that he was a man of more than
common genius: and this favourable impression
of his character will be confirmed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
by a consideration of the object of his life,
and the means he took to accomplish it.
Born in a province on the extreme verge
of India, at the very point where the religion
of Muhammed and the idolatrous
worship of the Hindús appeared to touch,
and at a moment when both these tribes
cherished the most violent rancour and animosity
towards each other, his great aim
was to blend those jarring elements in
peaceful union, and he only endeavoured
to effect this purpose through the means
of mild persuasion. His wish was to recall
both Muhammedans and Hindús to an
exclusive attention to that sublimest of all
principles, which inculcates devotion to
God, and peace towards man. He had
to combat the furious bigotry of the one,
and the deep-rooted superstition of the
other; but he attempted to overcome all
obstacles by the force of reason and humanity.
And we cannot have a more convincing
proof of the general character of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
that doctrine which he taught, and the inoffensive
light in which it was viewed, than
the knowledge that its success did not rouse
the bigotry of the intolerant and tyrannical
Muhammedan government under which he
lived.</p>

<p>Nánac did not deem either of his sons,
before mentioned, worthy of the succession
to his spiritual functions, which he bequeathed
to a Cshatríya of the Tréhún
tribe, called Lehana, who had long been
attached to him, and whom he had initiated
in the sacred mysteries of his sect, clothed
in the holy mantle of a Fakír, and honoured
with the name of Angad<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>, which, according
to some commentators, means <i>own
body</i>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<p>Gúrú Angad, for that is the name by
which he is known by all Sikhs, was born
at the village of Khandúr, on the bank of
the Béyah, or Hyphasis, in the province
of Lahore. His life does not appear to
have been distinguished by any remarkable
actions. He taught the same doctrine as
Nánac, and wrote some chapters that now
form part of the Grant'h. He left two
sons, Vásu and Dátu, but neither of them
was initiated; and he was succeeded, at
his death<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>, which happened in the year
A. D. 1552, and of the Samvat 1609, by
Amera Dás, a Cshatríya of the tribe of
B'halé, who performed the duties of a menial
towards him for upwards of twelve
years. It is stated, that the daily occupation
of Amera Dás was to bring water
from the Béyah river, a distance of six
miles, to wash the feet of his master; and
that one night, during a severe storm, as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was returning from his journey, his foot
slipped, and he fell and broke the vessel
that contained the river water, opposite the
door of a weaver, who lived next house
to Angad. The weaver, startled at the
noise, demanded, in a loud voice, of his
wife, from whence it proceeded. The
woman, who was well acquainted with the
daily toils and the devotion of Angad's
servant, replied, "It was poor Amera Dás,
who knows neither the sweets of sleep by
night, nor of rest by day." This conversation
was overheard by Angad; and when
Amera Dás came, next morning, to perform
his usual duties, he treated him with
extraordinary kindness, and said: "You
have endured great labour; but, henceforward,
enjoy rest." Amera Dás was
distinguished for his activity in preaching
the tenets of Nánac, and was very successful
in obtaining converts and followers;
by the aid of whom he established some
temporal power, built Kujaráwál, and separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
from the regular Sikhs the Udásí sect,
which was founded by Dherm-Chand, the
son of Nánac, and was probably considered,
at that period, as heretical.</p>

<p>Amera Dás had two children, a son
named Móhan, and a daughter named Móhani,
known by the name of B'háini; regarding
whose marriage he is stated to have
been very anxious: and as this event gave
rise to a dynasty of leaders, who are almost
adored among the Sikhs, it is recorded
with much minuteness by the writers of
that nation.</p>

<p>Amera Dás had communicated his wishes,
regarding the marriage of B'háini, to a Bráhmen,
who was his head servant, and directed
him to make some inquiries. The
Bráhmen did so, and reported to his master
that he had been successful, and had found
a youth every way suited to be the husband
of his daughter. As they were speaking
upon this subject in the street, Amera Dás<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
asked what was the boy's stature? "About
the same height as that lad," said the
Bráhmen, pointing to a youth standing
near them. The attention of Amera Dás
was instantly withdrawn from the Bráhmen,
and intently fixed upon the youth to whom
he had pointed. He asked him regarding
his tribe, his name, and his family. The
lad said his name was Rám Dás, and that
he was a Cshatríya, of a respectable family,
of the Sóndi tribe, and an inhabitant of the
village of Góndawál. Amera Dás, pleased
with the information he had received, took
no more notice of the Bráhmen and his
choice of a son-in-law, but gave his daughter
to the youth whom fortune had so casually
introduced to his acquaintance<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>. Amera<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Dás died in the year A. D. 1574, and of the
Samvat 1631, at the village of Góndawál,
in the province of Lahore, and was succeeded
by his son-in-law, Rám Dás<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>, whom
he had initiated in the sacred mysteries of
his holy profession, and who became famous
for his piety, and still more from the improvements
he made at Amritsar, which
was for some time called Rámpúr, or Rámdáspúr,
after him. Some Sikh authorities
ascribe the foundation of this city to him,
which is not correct, as it was a very
ancient town, known formerly under the
name of Chak. He, however, added much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
to its population, and built a famous tank,
or reservoir of water, which he called Amritsar,
a name signifying the water of immortality,
and which has become so sacred,
that it has given its name, and imparted its
sanctity, to the town of Rámdáspúr, which
has become the sacred city of the Sikh
nation, and is now only known by the name
of Amritsar.</p>

<p>After a life passed in the undisturbed
propagation of his tenets, in explanation of
which he wrote several works, he died, in
the year A. D. 1581, and of the Samvat
1638, at Amritsar, leaving two sons, Arjunmal
and Bharatmal. He was succeeded
by the former<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>,
who has rendered himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
famous by compiling the Adí-Grant'h<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>.
The Adí-Grant'h, or first sacred volume of
the Sikhs, contains ninety-two sections: it
was partly composed by Nánac and his
immediate successors, but received its present
form and arrangement from Arjunmal<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
who has blended his own additions with
what he deemed most valuable in the compositions
of his predecessors. It is Arjun,
then, who ought, from this act, to be deemed
the first who gave consistent form and order
to the religion of the Sikhs: an act which,
though it has produced the effect he wished,
of uniting that nation more closely, and of
increasing their numbers, proved fatal to
himself. The jealousy of the Muhammedan
government was excited, and he was made
its sacrifice. The mode of his death, which
happened in the year of Christ 1606, and
of the Samvat 1663, is related very differently
by different authorities: but several
of the most respectable agree in stating,
that his martyrdom, for such they term it,
was caused by the active hatred of a rival
Hindú zealot, Daníchand Cshatríya, whose
writings he refused to admit into the Adí-Grant'h,
on the ground that the tenets inculcated
in them were irreconcileable to the
pure doctrine of the unity and omnipotence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
of God, taught in that sacred volume.
This rival had sufficient influence with the
Muhammedan governor of the province to
procure the imprisonment of Arjun; who
is affirmed, by some writers, to have died
from the severity of his confinement; and,
by others, to have been put to death in the
most cruel manner. In whatever way his
life was terminated, there can be no doubt,
from its consequences, that it was considered,
by his followers, as an atrocious
murder, committed by the Muhammedan
government; and the Sikhs, who had been,
till then, an inoffensive, peaceable sect, took
arms under Har Góvind, the son of Arjunmal,
and wreaked their vengeance upon all
whom they thought concerned in the death
of their revered priest.</p>

<p>The contest carried on by Har Góvind
against the Muhammedan chiefs in the
Penjáb, though no doubt marked by that
animosity which springs from a deep and
implacable sense of injury on one part, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the insolence and violence of insulted power
on the other, could not have been of great
magnitude or importance, else it would
have been more noticed by contemporary
Muhammedan writers; but it was the first
fruits of that desperate spirit of hostility,
which was soon after to distinguish the
wars between the followers of Nánac and
those of Muhammed: and, from every account
of Har Góvind's life, it appears to
have been his anxious wish to inspire his
followers with the most irreconcileable hatred
of their oppressors.</p>

<p>It is stated, that this warlike<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Gúrú, or
priest militant, wore two swords in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
girdle. Being asked why he did so: "The
one," said he, "is to revenge the death
of my father; the other, to destroy the
miracles of Muhammed."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>Har Góvind is reputed, by some authors,
to have been the first who allowed his followers
to eat<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> the flesh of all animals, with
the exception of the cow: and it appears not
improbable that he made this great change
in their diet at the time when he effected a
still more remarkable revolution in their
habits, by converting a race of peaceable
enthusiasts into an intrepid band of soldiers<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>.
He had five sons, Bábú Gúrúdaitya,
Saurat Singh, Tégh Bahádur, Anna
Ráy, and Atal Ráy. The two last died<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
without descendants. Saurat Singh and
Tégh Singh, or Tégh Bahádur, were, by
the cruel persecution of the Muhammedans,
forced to fly into the mountains to the
northward of the Penjáb. His eldest son,
Gurudaítya, died early, but left two sons,
Dáharmal and Har Ráy; the latter of whom
succeeded his grandfather, who died in the
year A. D. 1644, and of the Samvat 1701.
It does not appear that Har Ráy enjoyed
much temporal power, or that he entered
into any hostilities with the Muhammedans:
his rule was tranquil, and passed
without any remarkable event; owing, probably,
to the vigor which the Muhammedan
power had attained in the early
part of the reign of Aurungzéb. At his
death, which happened in the year A. D.
1661, and of the Samvat 1718, a violent
contest arose among the Sikhs, regarding
the succession to the office of spiritual
leader; for the temporal power of their
ruler was, at this period, little more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
nominal. The dispute between his sons,
or, as some Sikh authors state, his son and
grandson, Har Crishn and Rám Ráy, was
referred to Dehli, whither both parties went;
and, by an imperial decree of Aurungzéb,
the Sikhs were allowed to elect their own
priest. They chose Har Crishn, who died
at Dehli in the year A. D. 1664, and of the
Samvat 1721; and was succeeded by his
uncle, Tégh Behádur. He, however, had
to encounter the most violent opposition
from his nephew, Rám Ráy<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>, who remained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
at Dehli, and endeavoured, by every art
and intrigue, to effect his ruin: he was
seized, and brought to Dehli, in consequence
of his nephew's misrepresentations;
and, after being in prison for two years,
was released at the intercession of Jayasingh,
Rájá of Jayapúr, whom he accompanied
to Bengal. Tégh Behádur afterwards took
up his abode at the city of Patna<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>; but
was pursued, agreeable to Sikh authors, to
his retreat, with implacable rancour, by the
jealousy and ambition of Rám Ráy; who
at last accomplished the destruction of his
rival. He was brought from Patna, and,
by the accounts of the same authors, publicly
put to death, without even the allegation
of a crime, beyond a firm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
undaunted assertion of the truth of that
faith of which he was the high priest.
This event is said to have taken place in
the year A. D. 1675, and of the Samvat
1732: but the Sikh records of their own
history, from the death of Har Góvind to
that of Tégh Behádur, are contradictory
and unsatisfactory, and appear to merit
little attention. The fact is, that the sect
was almost crushed, in consequence of their
first effort to attain power, under Har Góvind;
and, from the period of his death to
that of Tégh Behádur, the Mogul empire
was, as has been before stated, in the zenith
of its power, under Aurungzéb: and the
Sikhs, who had never attained any real
strength, were rendered still weaker by
their own internal dissensions. Their writers
have endeavoured to supply this chasm in
their history by a fabulous account of the
numerous miracles which were wrought by
their priests, Rám Ráy, Har Crishn, and
even the unfortunate Tégh Behádur, at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
Delhi, all of whom are said to have astonished
the emperor and his nobles, by a
display of their supernatural powers: but
their wide difference from each other, in
these relations, would prove, if any proof
was wanting, that all the annals of that
period are fabricated.</p>

<p>The history of the Sikhs, after the death
of Tégh Behádur, assumes a new aspect.
It is no longer the record of a sect, who,
revering the conciliatory and mild tenets of
their founder, desired more to protect themselves
than to injure others; but that of a
nation, who, adding to a deep sense of the
injuries they had sustained from a bigotted
and overbearing government, all the ardour
of men commencing a military career of
glory, listened, with rapture, to a son glowing
with vengeance against the murderers
of his father, who taught a doctrine suited
to the troubled state of his mind, and called
upon his followers, by every feeling of manhood,
to lay aside their peaceable habits, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
graft the resolute courage of the soldier on
the enthusiastic faith of the devotee, to
swear eternal war with the cruel and haughty
Muhammedans, and to devote themselves
to <i>steel</i>, as the only means of obtaining
every blessing that this world, or that to
come, could afford to mortals.</p>

<p>This was the doctrine of Gúrú Góvind,
the son of Tégh Behádur; who, though
very young at his father's death, had his
mind imbued with the deepest horror at
that event, and cherished a spirit of implacable
resentment against those whom he
considered as his murderers. Devoting his
life to this object, we find him, when quite
a youth, at the head of a large party of his
followers, amid the hills of Srínagar, where
he gave proofs of that ardent and daring
mind, which afterwards raised him to such
eminence. He was not, however, able to
maintain himself against the prince of that
country, with whom he had entered into
hostilities; and, being obliged to leave it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
he went to the Penjáb, where he was
warmly welcomed by a Hindú chief in rebellion
against the government. This chief
gave Góvind possession of Mák'havál<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>, and
several other villages, where he settled with
his followers, and repaid his benefactor by
aiding him in his depredations. Góvind
appears, at this moment, to have been universally
acknowledged by the Sikhs, as their
Sat-gúrú, or chief spiritual leader; and he
used the influence which that station, his
sufferings, and the popularity of his cause,
gave him, to effect a complete change in
the habits and religion of his countrymen<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>.
It would be tedious and useless to follow
the Sikh writers through those volumes of
fables in which they have narrated the
wonders that prognosticated the rise of this,
the most revered of all their priests, to
power; or to enter, at any length, into
those accounts which they, and Góvind
himself, for he is equally celebrated as an
author and as a warrior, have given of his
exploits. It will be sufficient, for the purpose
of this sketch, to state the essential
changes which he effected in his tribe, and
the consequences of his innovations.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>Though the Sikhs had already, under
Har Góvind, been initiated in arms, yet
they appear to have used these only in self-defence:
and as every tribe of Hindús, from
the Bráhmen to the lowest of the Súdra,
may, in cases of necessity, use them without
any infringement of the original institutions
of their tribe, no violation of these institutions
was caused by the rules of Nánac;
which, framed with a view to conciliation,
carefully abstained from all interference
with the civil institutes of the Hindús. But
his more daring successor, Gúrú Góvind,
saw that such observances were at variance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
with the plans of his lofty ambition; and
he wisely judged, that the only means by
which he could ever hope to oppose the
Muhammedan government with success,
were not only to admit converts from all
tribes, but to break, at once, those rules by
which the Hindús had been so long chained;
to arm, in short, the whole population of
the country, and to make worldly wealth
and rank an object to which Hindús, of
every class, might aspire.</p>

<p>The extent to which Góvind succeeded
in this design will be more fully noticed in
another place. It is here only necessary to
state the leading features of those changes by
which he subverted, in so short a time, the
hoary institutions of Brahmá<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>, and excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
terror and astonishment in the minds of the
Muhammedan conquerors of India, who saw
the religious prejudices of the Hindús, which
they had calculated upon as one of the
pillars of their safety, because they limited
the great majority of the population to
peaceable occupations, fall before the touch
of a bold and enthusiastic innovator, who
opened at once, to men of the lowest tribe<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>,
the dazzling prospect of earthly glory. All
who subscribed to his tenets were upon a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
level, and the Bráhmen who entered his sect
had no higher claims to eminence than the
lowest Súdra who swept his house. It was
the object of Góvind to make all Sikhs
equal<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>, and that their advancement should
solely depend upon their exertions: and
well aware how necessary it was to inspire
men of a low race, and of groveling minds,
with pride in themselves, he changed the
name of his followers from Sikh to Singh,
or lion; thus giving to all his followers
that honourable title which had been before
exclusively assumed by the Rajapúts, the
first military class of Hindús: and every
Sikh felt himself at once elevated to rank
with the highest, by this proud appellation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The disciples of Góvind were required to
devote themselves to arms, always to have
<i>steel</i> about them in some shape or other; to
wear a blue dress; to allow their hair to
grow; to exclaim, when they met each other,
<i>Wá! Gúrújí ká khálsah! Wá! Gúrújí kí
futteh!</i> which means, "Success to the
state of the Gúrú! Victory attend the
Gúrú<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>!" The intention of some of these
institutions is obvious; such as that principle
of devotion to <i>steel</i>, by which all were
made soldiers; and that exclamation, which
made the success of their priest, and that
of the commonwealth, the object of their
hourly prayer. It became, in fact, the
watchword which was continually to revive,
in the minds of the Sikh disciple, the obligations
he owed to that community of
which he had become a member, and to
that faith which he had adopted.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<p>Of the causes which led Góvind to enjoin
his followers to regard it as impious to cut
the hair of their heads, or shave their
beards, very different accounts are given.
Several Muhammedan authors state, that
both this ordination, and the one which
directed his followers to wear blue clothes,
was given in consequence of his gratitude
to some Afghán mountaineers, who aided
his escape from a fort, in which he was
besieged, by clothing him in a chequered
blue dress, and causing him to allow his
hair to grow, in order to pass him for one
of their own Pírs, or holy fathers; in which
they succeeded. This account, however,
is not supported by any Sikh writer; and
one of the most respectable and best informed
authors of that sect states, that
when Gúrú Góvind first went to Anandpúr
Mák'haval, which was also called Césgher,
or the house of hair, he spent much of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
time in devotion, at a temple of Dúrga
Bhavaní, the goddess of courage, by whom
he was directed to unloose his hair and
draw his sword. Góvind, in consequence
of this pretended divine order, vowed he
would preserve his hair, as consecrated
to that divinity, and directed his followers
to do the same<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>. The origin of that blue
chequered<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> dress, which was at one time
worn by all Góvind's followers, and is still
worn by the Acálís, or <i>never-dying</i>, (the
most remarkable class of devotees of that
sect,) is differently stated by different authors:
but it appears probable, that both
these institutions proceeded from the policy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of Góvind, who sought to separate his followers
from all other classes of India, as
much by their appearance as by their religion:
and he judged with wisdom when
he gave consequence to such distinctions;
which, though first established as mere
forms, soon supersede the substance of
belief; and, when strengthened by usage,
become the points to which ignorant and
unenlightened minds have, in all ages of the
world, shown the most resolute and unconquerable
adherence.</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind inculcated his tenets upon
his followers by his preaching, his actions,
and his works; among which is the Dasama
Pádsháh ká Grant'h, or the book of the
tenth king or ruler; Gúrú Góvind being
the tenth leader of the sect from Nánac.
This volume, which is not limited to religious
subjects, but filled with accounts of
his own battles, and written with the view
of stirring up a spirit of valour and emulation
among his followers, is at least as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
much revered, among the Sikhs, as the
Adí-Grant'h of Arjunmal. Góvind is said
to have first instituted the Gúrú Mata, or
state council, among the Sikhs; which
meets at Amritsar. The constitution and
usages of this national assembly will be
described hereafter: it is here only necessary
to observe, that its institution adds
one more proof to those already stated, of
the comprehensive and able mind of this
bold reformer, who gave, by its foundation,
that form of a federative republic, to the
commonwealth of the Sikhs, which was
most calculated to rouse his followers from
their indolent habits, and deep-rooted prejudices,
by giving them a personal share in
the government, and placing within the
reach of every individual the attainment of
rank and influence in the state.</p>

<p>It could not be expected that Gúrú
Góvind could accomplish all those great
schemes he had planned. He planted the
tree; but it was not permitted, according to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
Sikh writers, that he should see it in that
maturity which it was destined to reach:
and this, these authors state, was foretold
to him by some Bráhmens, skilled in necromancy.
It would be tedious to dwell on
such fables<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>; and it is time to return to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
political life of Góvind, which is marked
by but few events of importance. These are
either related by Muhammedan authors,
who detract from all the pretensions of this
enemy of their faith and name; by his disciples,
who exalt the slightest of his actions
into the achievements of a divinity; or
by himself, for he wrote an account of his
own wars. This last work, however, is
more calculated to inflame the courage of
his followers, than to convey correct information
of actual events.</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind Singh, in the Vichitra Nátac,
a work written by himself, and inserted
in the Dasama Pádsháh ká Grant'h, traces
the descent of the Cshatríya tribe of Sóndí,
to which he belongs, from a race of Hindú<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Rájás<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>, who founded the cities of Casúr
and Lahore. He was born, he states, at
Patán, or Patna, and brought up at Madra
Dés, in the Penjáb. He went, after his
father's death, to the banks of the Cálíndí,
or Yamuná, and addicted himself to hunting
the wild beasts of the forest, and other
manly diversions: but this occupation, he
adds, offended the emperor of Dehli, who
ordered chiefs, of the Muhammedan race,
to attack him. Gúrú Góvind describes, in
this work, with great animation, his own
feats, and those of his friends<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>, in the first
of his actions; in which, by his account,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
the arrows of the Sikhs were victorious
over the sabres of the Muhammedans<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>This first success appears to have greatly
increased the number of Gúrú Góvind's
followers, whom he established at Anandpúr,
Khílór, and the towns in their vicinity;
where they remained, till called to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
aid the Rájá of Nadón<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>, Bhíma Chand,
who was threatened with an invasion by
the Rájá of Jammu; who had been excited
to hostilities by Mía Khán, a Mogul chief,
then at war with Bhíma Chand.</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind gives an account of this
war, which consisted of attacking and defending
the narrow passes of the mountains.
He describes Bhíma Chand and himself
as leading on their warriors, who advanced,
he says, to battle, "like a stream
of flame consuming the forest." They
were completely successful in this expedition;
the Rájá of Jammu, and his Muhammedan
allies, having been defeated,
and chased with disgrace across the Satléj.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>
<p>Gúrú Góvind next relates the advance
of the son of Diláwer Khán against him.
The object of the Muhammedan chief
appears to have been, to surprise Góvind
and his followers at night: but, when that
project was defeated, his troops were seized
with a panic, and fled from the Sikhs without
a contest. The father, enraged at the
disgraceful retreat of his son, collected all
his followers, and sent Husain Khán, who
made successful inroads upon the Sikhs,
taking several of their principal forts<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>. A
general action at last took place, in which
the Khán, after performing prodigies of
valour, was defeated, and lost his life. Gúrú
Góvind was not present at this battle.
"The lord of the earth," he says, "detained
me from this conflict, and caused
the rain of steel to descend in another
quarter."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>Diláwer Khán and Rustam Khán next
marched against the Sikhs, who appear to
have been disheartened at the loss of some
of their principal chiefs, and more at the
accounts they received of Aurungzéb's
rage at their progress, and of his having
detached his son to the district of Madra<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
in order to take measures to quell them. At
the prince's approach, "every body," says
Gúrú Góvind, "was struck with terror.
Unable to comprehend the ways of the
Eternal, several deserted me, and fled,
and took refuge in the lofty mountains.
These vile cowards were," he adds, "too
greatly alarmed in mind to understand
their own advantage; for the emperor
sent troops, who burnt the habitations of
those that had fled." He takes this occasion
of denouncing every misery that
this world can bring, and all the pains and
horrors of the next, on those who desert
their Gúrú, or priest. "The man who
does this," he writes, "shall neither have
child nor offspring. His aged parents
shall die in grief and sorrow, and he
shall perish like a dog, and be thrown
into hell to lament." After many more
curses on apostates, he concludes this anathema
by stating, that the good genius
of prosperity in this world, and eternal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
blessings in the next, shall be the certain
reward of all who remain attached to their
Gúrú: and, as an instance, he affirms, that
not one of those faithful followers, who had
adhered to him at this trying crisis, had
received the least injury<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>.</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind closes his first work, the
Vichitra Nátac, with a further representation
on the shame that attends apostasy,
and the rewards that await those that prove
true to their religion; and he concludes
by a prayer to the Deity, and a declaration
of his intention to compose, for the use
of his disciples, a still larger work; by which
the Sikhs conceive that he meant the rest
of the Dasama Pádsháh ká Grant'h, of
which the Vichitra Nátac forms the first
section.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>
<p>An account of Góvind's war with the
Rájá of Kahilúr<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>, is found in a work written
in the Dúgar, or mountain dialect of
the Penjábi tongue, which gives an account
of some other actions of this chief. Though
this account is greatly exaggerated, it no
doubt states some facts correctly, and therefore
merits a brief notice. According to
this authority, the Rájás of Kahilúr, Jiswál,
and others, being defeated and disgraced in
several actions, applied to the court of
Aurungzéb for aid against Gúrú Góvind,
from whom they stated that they had
received great injuries. When the emperor
asked who made the complaint, the answer
was: "It is the chief of Kahilúr, thy
servant, who has been despoiled of his
country by violence, though a faithful
Zemindar (landholder), and one who has
always been punctual in paying his contributions."
Such were the representations,
this author states, by which they
obtained the aid of an army from the
emperor.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>
<p>Their combined forces proceeded against
Gúrú Góvind and his followers, who
were obliged to shut themselves up in
their fortresses, where they endured every
misery that sickness and famine can bring
upon a besieged place. Góvind, after
suffering the greatest hardships, determined
to attempt his escape. He ordered
his followers to leave the fort, one by one,
at midnight, and to separate the moment
they went out. The misery of this separation,
which divided the father from the
child, the husband from the wife, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
brothers from sisters, was horrible; but it
was the only chance which they had of
safety, and his orders were obeyed. He
himself went, among the rest; and, after
undergoing great fatigue, and escaping
many dangers, he arrived at Chamkóur, by
the Rájá of which place he was received in
a kind and friendly manner. His enemies
had entered the fortress which Góvind left,
the moment he fled, and made many prisoners;
among which were his mother and
his two children, who were carried to
Foujdar Khán, the governor of Sirhind,
by whose orders they were inhumanly massacred<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>.
The army of the emperor, aided
by the Rájás hostile to Góvind, next marched
to Chamkóur, and encompassed it on all
sides. Góvind, in despair, clasping his
hands, called upon the goddess of the
sword<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>.  "The world sees," he exclaimed,
"that we have no help but thee!" saying
which, he prepared, with his few followers,
to make the most desperate resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>The emperor's army, employed at this
period against Góvind, was commanded by
Khwájeh Muhammed and Nahar Khán,
who deputed, at the commencement of the
siege, an envoy to the Sikh leader, with the
following message: "This army is not one
belonging to Rájás and Ránás: it is that
of the great Aurungzéb: show, therefore,
thy respect, and embrace the true faith."
The envoy proceeded, in the execution of
his mission, with all the pride of those he
represented. "Listen," said he, from himself
to Gúrú Góvind, "to the words of the
Nawáb: leave off contending with us,
and playing the infidel; for it is evident
you never can reap advantage from such
an unequal war." He was stopped by
Ajit Singh, the son of Góvind, from saying
more. That youth, seizing his scimetar,
exclaimed: "If you utter another word, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
will humble your pride: I will smite
your head from your body, and cut you
to pieces, for daring to speak such language
before our chiefs." The blood of
the envoy boiled with rage, and he returned
with this answer to his master.</p>

<p>This effort to subdue the fortitude and
faith of Góvind having failed, the siege
commenced with great vigour. A long
description is given by B'hai Gúrú Dás
B'halé and other Sikh authors, of the actions
that were performed. Amongst the
most distinguished, were those of the brave,
but unfortunate, Ajit Singh<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
Gúrú Góvind, whose death is thus recorded:
"A second time the Khán advanced, and
the battle raged. Some fought, some
fled. Ajit Singh, covered with glory,
departed to Swarga (heaven). Indra<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>,
first of the gods (Dévatás), advanced
with the celestial host to meet him; he
conducted him to Dévapúr, the city of
the gods, and seated him on a celestial
throne: having remained there a short
time, he proceeded to the region of the
sun. Thus," he concludes, "Ajit Singh
departed in glory; and his fame extends
over three worlds, for the fame of the
warrior lives for ever."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Though Góvind showed an invincible
spirit, and performed prodigies of valour,
having killed, with his own hand, Nahar
Khán, and wounded Khwájeh Muhammed,
the other leader of the emperor's troops,
it was impossible to contend longer against
such superior numbers; and he at last,
taking advantage of a dark night, fled from
Chamkóur, covering his face, according to
the Sikh author, from shame at his own
disgrace.</p>

<p>This sketch of the life of Góvind is compiled
from his own works, and those of
other Sikh writers, such as Nand and B'hai
Gúrú Dás; and the events recorded, allowing
for the colouring with which such narratives
are written in the East, appear to be
correct: the leading facts are almost all
established by the evidence of contemporary
Muhammedan writers, to whom we must
trust for the remainder of his history; as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the authorities we have followed end at the
period of his flight from Chamkóur.</p>

<p>Most accounts agree that Gúrú Góvind,
after his flight, was, from a sense of his
misfortunes, and the loss of his children,
bereft of his reason, and wandered about
for a considerable time in the most deplorable
condition. One account states,
that he died in the Penjáb; another, that
he went to Patna, where he ended his days;
a third, taken from a Sikh authority<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a>, asserts
that Gúrú Góvind, after remaining
some time in the Lak'hi-Jungle, to which
he had fled, returned without molestation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to his former residence in the Penjáb; and
that, so far from meeting with any persecution
from the Muhammedan government,
he received favours from the emperor,
Baháder Sháh; who, aware of his
military talents, gave him a small military
command in the Dek'hin, where he was
stabbed by a Patán soldier's son, and expired
of his wounds, in the year 1708, at
Nadér, a town situated on the Godaveri river,
about one hundred miles from Haiderabad.</p>

<p>It is sufficiently established, from these
contradictory and imperfect accounts of the
latter years of Gúrú Góvind, that he performed
no actions worthy of record after
his flight from Chamkóur: and when we
consider the enthusiastic ardour of his mind,
his active habits, his valour, and the insatiable
thirst of revenge, which he had
cherished through life, against the murderers
of his father, and the oppressors of
his sect, we cannot think, when that leading
passion of his mind must have been increased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
by the massacre of his children,
and the death or mutilation<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> of his most
attached followers, that he would have
remained inactive; much less that he would
have sunk into a servant of that government,
against which he had been in constant
rebellion: nor is it likely that such a
leader as Gúrú Góvind could ever have
been trusted by a Muhammedan prince:
and there appears, therefore, every reason
to give credit to those accounts which state,
that mental distraction, in consequence of
deep distress and disappointment, was the
cause of the inactivity of Gúrú Góvind's
declining years. Nor is such a conclusion at
all at variance with the fact of his being
killed at Nadér, as it is probable, even if
he was reduced to the state described, that
he continued, till the close of his existence,
that wandering and adventurous life to
which he had been so early accustomed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<p>In the character of this reformer of the
Sikhs, it is impossible not to recognise
many of those features which have distinguished
the most celebrated founders of
political communities. The object he attempted
was great and laudable. It was
the emancipation of his tribe from oppression
and persecution; and the means
which he adopted, were such as a comprehensive
mind could alone have suggested.
The Muhammedan conquerors of India, as
they added to their territories, added to
their strength, by making proselytes through
the double means of persuasion and force;
and these, the moment they had adopted
their faith, became the supporters of their
power against the efforts of the Hindús;
who, bound in the chains of their civil and
religious institutions, could neither add to
their number by admitting converts, nor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
allow more than a small proportion of the
population of the country to arm against
the enemy. Góvind saw that he could
only hope for success by a bold departure
from usages which were calculated to keep
those, by whom they were observed, in
a degraded subjection to an insulting and
intolerant race. "You make Hindús Muhammedans,
and are justified by your
laws," he is said to have written to Aurungzéb:
"now I, on a principle of self-preservation,
which is superior to all
laws, will make Muhammedans Hindús<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>.
You may rest," he added, "in fancied
security: but beware! for I will teach
the sparrow to strike the eagle to the
ground." A fine allusion to his design of
inspiring the lowest races among the Hindús
with that valour and ambition which would
lead them to perform the greatest actions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<p>The manner in which Góvind endeavoured
to accomplish the great plan he
had formed, has been exhibited in the imperfect
sketch given of his life. His efforts
to establish that temporal power in his own
person, of which he laid the foundation for
his tribe, were daring and successful in as
great a degree as circumstances would
admit: but it was not possible he could
create means, in a few years, to oppose,
with success, the force of one of the greatest
empires in the universe. The spirit, however,
which he infused into his followers,
was handed down as a rich inheritance to
their children; who, though they consider
Bábá Nánác as the author of their religion,
revere, with a just gratitude, Gúrú Góvind,
as the founder of their worldly greatness
and political independence. They are conscious,
indeed, that they have become, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
the adoption of his laws and institutions,
the scourge of their enemies; and have conquered
and held, for more than half a
century, the finest portion of the once great
empire of the house of Taimúr.</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind was the last acknowledged
religious ruler of the Sikhs. A prophecy
had limited their spiritual guides to the
number of ten; and their superstition, aided,
no doubt, by the action of that spirit of
independence which his institutions had
introduced, caused its fulfilment. The success,
however, of Banda, a Bairági, who
was the devoted follower and friend of
Gúrú Góvind, established their union under
his banners. A short period after Góvind's
death, the grief of Banda at the misfortune
of his priest, is said, by Sikh authors, to
have settled into a gloomy and desperate
desire to revenge his wrongs. The confusion
which took place on the death of
Aurungzéb, which happened in the year
1707, was favourable to his wishes. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
plundering the country, and defeating most
of the petty Muhammedan chiefs that were
opposed to him, he thought himself sufficiently
strong to venture on an action with
Foujdar Khán, the governor of the province
of Sarhind, and the man of all others most
abhorred by the Sikhs, as the murderer of
the infant children of Gúrú Góvind. This
action was fought with valour by the Muhammedans;
and with all that desperation
on the part of the Sikhs, which the most
savage spirit of revenge could inspire: and
this, aided by the courage and conduct
of their leader, gave them the victory, after
a severe contest. Foujdar Khán fell, with
most of his army, to whom the enraged
Sikhs gave no quarter. Nor was their savage
revenge satiated by the destruction of the
Muhammedan army: they put to death
the wife and children of Vizír Khán, and
almost all the inhabitants of Sarhind. They
destroyed or polluted the mosques of that
city; and, in a spirit of wild and brutal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
rage, dug up the carcasses of the dead,
and exposed them to be devoured by
beasts of prey. Encouraged by this success,
and hardened by the lessons of
Banda to deeds of the most horrid atrocity,
the Sikhs rushed forward, and subdued
all the country between the Satléj
and the Jumna; and, crossing that river,
made inroads into the province of Sáháranpúr<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a>.
It is unnecessary to state
the particulars of this memorable incursion,
which, from all accounts, appears to have
been one of the severest scourges with
which a country was ever afflicted. Every
excess that the most wanton barbarity could
commit, every cruelty that an unappeased
appetite of revenge could suggest, was inflicted
upon the miserable inhabitants of
the provinces through which they passed.
Life was only granted to those who conformed
to the religion, and adopted the
habits and dress of the Sikhs; and if Behádur
Sháh had not quitted the Dek'hin,
which he did in A. D. 1710, there is reason
to think the whole of Hindústan would
have been subdued by these merciless invaders.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>
<p>The first check the Sikhs received was
from an army under Sultán Kúli Khán.
That chief defeated one of their advanced
corps at Pánipat'h, which, after being dispersed,
fled to join their leader Banda, at
Sarhind. The death of Behádur Sháh prevented
this success from being pursued;
and the confusion which followed that event,
was favourable to the Sikhs. Banda defeated
Islám Khán, the viceroy of Lahore,
and one of his fanatic followers stabbed
Báyezíd Khán, the governor of Sarhind,
who had marched out of that town to
encounter this army. This, however, was
the last of Banda's successful atrocities.
Abdal Sámad Khán, a general of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
reputation, was detached, with a large army,
by the emperor Farakhseir, against the
Sikhs, whom he defeated in a very desperate
action; in which, agreeable to Muhammedan
authors, Banda performed prodigies
of valour, and was only obliged to
give way to the superior numbers and discipline
of the imperialists. The Sikhs were
never able to make a stand after this defeat,
and were hunted, like wild beasts, from one
strong hold to another, by the army of
the emperor; by whom their leader, and
his most devoted followers, were at last
taken, after having suffered every extreme
of hunger and fatigue<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>Abdal Sámad Khán put to death great
numbers of the Sikhs after the surrender of
Lóhgad, the fortress in which they took
refuge; but sent Banda, and the principal
chiefs of the tribe, to Dehli, where they
were first treated with every kind of obloquy
and insult, and then executed. A Muhammedan
writer<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> relates the intrepidity
with which these Sikh prisoners, but particularly
their leader, Banda, met death.
"It is singular," he writes, "that these
people not only behaved firmly during
the execution, but they would dispute
and wrangle with each other who should
suffer first; and they made interest with
the executioner to obtain the preference.
Banda," he continues, "was at last produced,
his son being seated in his lap.
His father was ordered to cut his throat,
which he did, without uttering one word.
Being then brought nearer the magistrate's
tribunal, the latter ordered his
flesh to be torn off with red hot pincers;
and it was in those moments he expired:
his black soul taking its flight, by one of
those wounds, towards the regions for
which it was so well fitted."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus perished Banda; who, though a
brave and able leader, was one of the most
cruel and ferocious of men, and endeavoured
to impart to his followers that feeling
of merciless resentment which he cherished
against the whole Muhammedan
race, whom he appears to have thought
accountable for the cruelty and oppression
of a few individuals of the persuasion<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>
<p>Though the Sikhs, from being animated
by a similar feeling, and encouraged by his
first successes, followed Banda to the field,
they do not revere his memory; and he
is termed, by some of their authors, a
heretic; who, intoxicated with victory, endeavoured
to change the religious institutions
and laws of Gúrú Góvind, many of
whose most devoted followers this fierce
chief put to death, because they refused
to depart from those usages which that
revered spiritual leader had taught them to
consider sacred. Among other changes,
Banda wished to make the Sikhs abandon
their blue dress, to refrain from drinking
and eating flesh; and, instead of exclaiming
<i>Wá! Gúrúji ki Futteh! Wá! Khálsaji
ki Futteh!</i> the salutations directed by Góvind,
he directed them to exclaim, <i>Futteh
D'herm! Futteh dersan!</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> which means,
"Success to piety! Success to the sect!"
These innovations were very generally resisted;
but the dreaded severity of Banda
made many conform to his orders. The
class of Acálís<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>, or immortals, who had
been established by Gúrú Góvind, continued
to oppose the innovations with great
obstinacy; and many of them suffered martyrdom,
rather than change either their
mode of salutation, diet, or dress; and,
at the death of Banda, their cause triumphed.
All the institutions of Gúrú Góvind
were restored: but the blue dress,
instead of being, as at first, worn by all,
appears, from that date, to have become
the particular right of the Acálís, whose
valour, in its defence, well merited the exclusive
privilege of wearing this original
uniform of a true Sikh.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<p>After the defeat and death of Banda,
every measure was taken, that an active
resentment could suggest, not only to destroy
the power, but to extirpate the race,
of the Sikhs. An astonishing number of
that sect must have fallen, in the last two
or three years of the contest with the imperial
armies, as the irritated Muhammedans
gave them no quarter. After the
execution of their chief, a royal edict was
issued, ordering all who professed the religion
of Nánac to be taken and put to
death, wherever found. To give effect
to this mandate, a reward was offered for
the head of every Sikh; and all Hindús
were ordered to shave their hair off, under
pain of death. The few Sikhs, that escaped
this general execution, fled into the mountains
to the N. E. of the Penjáb, where
they found a refuge from the rigorous persecution
by which their tribe was pursued;
while numbers bent before the tempest
which they could not resist, and abandoning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
the outward usages of their religion, satisfied
their consciences with the secret practice
of its rites.</p>

<p>From the defeat and death of Banda
till the invasion of India by Nádir Sháh,
a period of nearly thirty years, we hear
nothing of the Sikhs; but, on the occurrence
of that event, they are stated to have
fallen upon the peaceable inhabitants of the
Penjáb, who sought shelter in the hills, and
to have plundered them of that property
which they were endeavouring to secure
from the rapacity of the Persian invader.</p>

<p>Enriched with these spoils, the Sikhs left
the hills, and built the fort of Dalewál, on
the Rávi, from whence they made predatory
incursions, and are stated to have
added both to their wealth and reputation,
by harassing and plundering the rear of
Nádir Sháh's army, which, when it returned
to Persia, was encumbered with spoil, and
marched, from a contempt of its enemies,
with a disregard to all order.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>The weak state to which the empire of
Hindústan was reduced; and the confusion
into which the provinces of Lahore and
Cábul were thrown, by the death of Nádir;
were events of too favourable a nature to
the Sikhs to be neglected by that race, who
became daily more bold, from their numbers
being greatly increased by the union
of all those who had taken shelter in the
mountains; the readmission into the sect
of those who, to save their lives, had abjured,
for a period, their usages; and the
conversion of a number of proselytes, who
hastened to join a standard, under which
robbery was made sacred; and to plunder,
was to be pious.</p>

<p>Aided with these recruits, the Sikhs now extended
their irruptions over most of the
provinces of the Penjáb: and though it was
some time before they repossessed themselves
of Amritsar, they began, immediately
after they quitted their fastnesses, to flock
to that holy city at the periods of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
feasts. Some performed this pilgrimage in
secret, and in disguise: but in general, according
to a contemporary Muhammedan
author, the Sikh horsemen were seen riding,
at full gallop, towards "their favourite
shrine of devotion. They were often
slain in making this attempt, and sometimes
taken prisoners; but they used, on
such occasions, to seek, instead of avoiding,
the crown of martyrdom: and the
same authority states, that an instance
was never known of a Sikh, taken in his
way to Amritsar, consenting to abjure his
faith."</p>

<p>It is foreign to the object of this sketch
to enter into a detail of those efforts by
which the Sikhs rose into that power which
they now possess. It will be sufficient to
glance at the principal events which have
marked their progress, from the period of
their emerging from the mountains, to which
they had been driven after the death of
Banda, to that of the conquest and subjection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of those fine provinces over which their
rule is now established. This sect, as has
been before stated, have never admitted
a spiritual leader since the death of Gúrú
Góvind. It was success, and the force of
a savage but strong genius, which united
them, for a period, under Banda; and they
have, since his death, had no acknowledged
general, leader, or prince. Each individual
followed to the field the Sirdar or chief,
who, from birth, the possession of property,
or from valour and experience, had become
his superior. These chiefs again were of
different rank and pretensions: a greater
number of followers, higher reputation, the
possession of wealth, or lands, constituted
that difference; and, from one or other of
these causes, one chief generally enjoyed a
decided pre-eminence, and, consequently,
had a lead in their military councils. But,
nevertheless, they always went through the
form of selecting a military leader at their
Gúrú-matá, or national council; where,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
however, influence prevailed, and the most
powerful was certain of being elected.</p>

<p>Such a mode of government was in itself
little calculated to give that strength and
union which the cause of the Sikhs required:
but the peculiarities of their usages,
the ardent character of their faith, the power
of their enemies, and the oppression they
endured, amply supplied the place of all
other ordinances. To unite and to act in
one body, and on one principle, was, with
the first Sikhs, a law of necessity: it was,
amid the dangers with which they were
surrounded, their only hope of success, and
their sole means of preservation: and it
was to these causes, combined with the
weakness and internal contests of their enemies,
to which this sect owes its extraordinary
rise,&mdash;not to their boasted constitution;
which, whether we call it an oligarchy,
which it really is; or a theocracy, which the
Sikhs consider it; has not a principle in its
composition that would preserve it one day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
from ruin, if vigorously assailed. But of
this their history will furnish the best
example.</p>

<p>Encouraged by the confusion which took
place on the first Afghán<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> invasion, the
Sikhs made themselves masters of a considerable
part of the Duáb of Rávi and
Jaléndra<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>, and extended their incursions
to the neighbouring countries. They, however,
at this period received several severe
checks from Mír Manu, the governor of
Lahore, who is said, by Muhammedan
authors, to have been only withheld from
destroying them by the counsel of his
minister, Kodá Mal, who was himself a
Sikh of the Khalása<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> tribe. Mír Manu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
appointed Adína Bég Khán to the charge
of the countries in which the Sikhs maintained
themselves; and, as that able but
artful chief considered this turbulent tribe
in no other light than as the means of his
personal advancement, he was careful not
to reduce them altogether; but, after defeating
them in an action, which was fought
near Mak'havál, he entered into a secret
understanding with them, by which, though
their excursions were limited, they enjoyed
a security to which they had been unaccustomed,
and from which they gathered
strength and resources for future efforts.</p>

<p>At the death of Mír Manu<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a>, the Sikhs
took all those advantages, which the local
distractions of a falling empire offered them,
of extending and establishing their power.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Their bands, under their most active leaders,
plundered in every direction, and were successful
in obtaining possession of several
countries, from which they have never since
been expelled: and their success, at this
period, was promoted, instead of being
checked, by the appointment of their old
friend, Adína Bég Khán, to Lahore; as
that brave chief, anxious to defend his own
government against the Afgháns, immediately
entered into a confederacy with the
Sikhs, whom he encouraged to plunder the
territories of Ahmed Sháh Abdáli.</p>

<p>The Afghán monarch, resenting this predatory
warfare, in which the governor of
Lahore was supported by the court of
Dehli, determined upon invading India.
Adína Bég, unable to oppose him, fled;
and the Sikhs could only venture to plunder
the baggage, and cut off the stragglers of
the Afghán army; by which they so irritated
Ahmed Sháh, that he threatened them with
punishment on his return; and, when he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
marched to Cábul, he left his son, Taimúr
Khán, and his vizír, Jehán Khán, at Lahore,
with orders to take vengeance on the
Sikhs for all the excesses which they had
committed. The first expedition of Taimúr
Khán was against their capital, Amritsar,
which he destroyed, filling up their sacred
tank, and polluting all their places of worship:
by which action he provoked the
whole race to such a degree, that they all
assembled at Lahore, and not only attempted
to cut off the communication
between the fort and country, but collected
and divided the revenues of the towns and
villages around it. Taimúr Khán, enraged
at this presumption, made several attacks
upon them, but was constantly defeated;
and being at last reduced to the necessity
of evacuating Lahore, and retreating to
Cábul, the Sikhs, under one of their celebrated
leaders, called Jasa Singh Calál, immediately
took possession of the vacant
Subah of Lahore, and ordered rupees to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
coined, with an inscription to the following
import: "Coined by the grace of Khálsah
jí, in the country of Ahmed, conquered
by Jasa Singh Calál."</p>

<p>The Sikhs, who were so deeply indebted
to the forbearance of Adína Bég Khán,
now considered themselves above the power
of that chief; who, in order to regain his
government from them and the Afgháns,
was obliged to invite the Mahráta leaders,
Raghunát'h Ráo, Sáheb Pateil, and Malhár
Ráo, to enter the Penjáb. Aided by these
chiefs, he first advanced to Sarhind, where
he was joined by some Sikhs that remained
attached to him. Sámad Khán, the officer
who had been left in charge of Sarhind
by Ahmed Khán, found himself obliged to
evacuate that place; which he had no
sooner done, than the Sikhs began to
plunder. The Mahrátas, always jealous of
their booty, determined to attack and punish
them for this violation of what they deemed
their exclusive privilege: but Adína Bég<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
receiving intelligence of their intentions,
communicated it to the Sikhs; who, taking
advantage of the darkness of the night,
saved themselves by flight.</p>

<p>After the fall of Sarhind, the Mahrátas,
accompanied by Adína Bég Khán, advanced
to Lahore, and soon expelled both
the Sikhs and the Afgháns from the principal
towns of the provinces of Sarhind and
Lahore; of which they not only took possession,
but sent a governor to the province
of Multán; and Sáheb Pateil advanced to
the Attock<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>, where he remained for a few
months. But the commotions of Hindústan
and the Dek'hin soon obliged these
foreigners to abandon the Penjáb; which
they did the same year they had reduced
it. They appointed Adína Bég Khán governor
of Lahore. He died in the ensuing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
year; and, by his death, afforded an opportunity
to the Sikhs, which they eagerly
seized, to make themselves again masters
of the province of Lahore. Their success
was, however, soon checked by Ahmed
Sháh Abdáli; who, irritated by their unsubdued
turbulence, and obstinate intrepidity,
made every effort (after he had gained the
victory of Pánipat'h, which established his
supremacy at Dehli) to destroy their power;
and, with this view, he entered the Penjáb
early in 1762, and overran the whole of
that country with a numerous army, defeating
and dispersing the Sikhs in every direction.
That sect, unable to make any stand
against the army of the Abdáli, pursued
their old plan of retreating near the mountains;
and collected a large force in the
northern districts of Sarhind, a distance of
above one hundred miles from Lahore,
where the army of Ahmed Sháh was encamped.
Here they conceived themselves
to be in perfect safety: but that prince<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
made one of those rapid movements for
which he was so celebrated, and reaching
the Sikh army on the second day, completely
surprised, and defeated it with great
slaughter. In this action, which was fought
in February, 1762, the Sikhs are said to
have lost upwards of twenty thousand men,
and the remainder fled into the hills, abandoning
all the lower countries to the Afgháns,
who committed every ravage that a
barbarous and savage enemy could devise.
Amritsar was razed to the ground, and the
sacred reservoir again choaked with its
ruins. Pyramids<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> were erected, and covered
with the heads of slaughtered Sikhs: and it
is mentioned, that Ahmed Sháh caused the
walls of those mosques, which the Sikhs
had polluted, to be washed with their blood,
that the contamination might be removed,
and the insult offered to the religion of Muhammed
expiated<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>This species of savage retaliation appears
to have animated, instead of depressing, the
courage of the Sikhs; who, though they
could not venture to meet Ahmed Sháh's
army in action, harassed it with an incessant
predatory warfare; and, when that
sovereign was obliged, by the commotions
of Afghánistan, to return to Cábul, they
attacked and defeated the general he had
left in Lahore, and made themselves masters
of that city, in which they levelled with the
ground those mosques which the Afgháns
had, a few months before, purified with the
blood of their brethren.</p>

<p>Ahmed Sháh, in 1763, retook Lahore,
and plundered the provinces around it; but,
being obliged to return to his own country in
the ensuing year, the Sikhs again expelled his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
garrison, and made themselves masters of the
Penjáb; and, from that period until his death,
a constant war was maintained, in which
the enterprise and courage of the Afgháns
gradually gave way before the astonishing
activity and invincible perseverance of their
enemies; who, if unable to stand a general
action, retreated to impenetrable mountains,
and the moment they saw an advantage,
rushed again into the plains with renewed
vigour, and recruited numbers. Several
Sikh authors, treating of the events of this
period, mention a great action having been
fought, by their countrymen, near Amritsar,
against the whole Afghán army, commanded
by Ahmed Sháh in person; but they differ
with regard to the date of this battle, some
fixing it in 1762, and others later. They
pretend that the Sikhs, inspired by the
sacredness of the ground on which this
action was fought, contended for victory
against superior numbers with the most
desperate fury, and that the battle terminated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
in both parties quitting the field,
without either being able to claim the least
advantage. The historians of Ahmed Sháh
are, however, silent regarding this action;
which, indeed, from all the events of his
long contests with the Sikhs, appears unlikely
to have occurred. It is possible the
Sikhs fought, at Amritsar, with a division of
the Afghán army, and that might have been
commanded by the prince; but it is very
improbable they had ever force to encounter
the concentrated army of the Abdális;
before which, while it remained in
a body, they appear, from the first to the
last of their contests with that prince, to
have always retreated, or rather fled.</p>

<p>The internal state of Afghánistan, since
the death of Ahmed Sháh, has prevented
the progress of the Sikh nation receiving
any serious check from that quarter; and
the distracted and powerless condition of
the empire of India has offered province
after province to their usurpation. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
history, during this latter period, affords
little but a relation of village warfare, and
predatory incursions. Their hostilities were
first directed against the numerous Muhammedan
chiefs who were settled in the
Penjáb, and who defended, as long as they
could, their jágírs, or estates, against them:
but these have either been conquered, or
reduced to such narrow limits, as to owe
their security to their insignificance, or
the precarious friendship of some powerful
Sikh chief, whose support they have
gained; and who, by protecting them
against the other leaders of his tribe, obtains
a slight accession of strength and
influence.</p>

<p>The Sikh nation, who have, throughout
their early history, always appeared, like a
suppressed flame, to rise into higher splendour
from every attempt to crush them,
had become, while they were oppressed, as
formidable for their union, as for their determined
courage and unconquerable spirit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
resistance: but a state of persecution and
distress was the one most favourable for the
action of a constitution like theirs; which,
formed upon general and abstract principles,
required constant and great sacrifices
of personal advantage to the public
good; and such can alone be expected
from men, acting under the influence of
that enthusiasm, which the fervor of a new
religion, or a struggle for independence, can
alone impart, and which are ever most
readily made, when it becomes obvious to
all, that a complete union in the general
cause is the only hope of individual
safety.</p>

<p>The Sikhs would appear, from their own
historians, to have attributed the conquests
they made entirely to their valour, and to
have altogether forgot that they owed them
chiefly to the decline of the house of Taimúr,
and the dissensions of the government
of Cábul. Intoxicated with their success,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
they have given way to all those passions
which assail the minds of men in the possession
of power. The desire, which every
petty chief entertained, of increasing his
territories, of building strong forts, and
adding to the numbers of his troops, involved
them in internal wars; and these,
however commenced, soon communicated
to numbers, who engaged in the dispute as
passion or interest dictated. Though such
feuds have, no doubt, helped to maintain
their military spirit, yet their extent and
virulence have completely broken down
that union, which their great legislator,
Góvind, laboured to establish. Quarrels
have been transmitted from father to son;
and, in a country where the infant is devoted
to <i>steel</i>, and taught to consider war
as his only occupation, these could not
but multiply in an extraordinary degree;
and, independent of the comparative large
conquests in which the greater chiefs occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
engaged, every village<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> has become
an object of dispute; and there are few, if
any, in the Penjáb, the rule of which is not
contested between brothers or near relations<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>.
In such a state, it is obvious, the
Sikhs could alone be formidable to the
most weak and distracted governments.
Such, indeed, was the character, till within
a very late period, of all their neighbours;
and they continued to plunder, with impunity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the upper provinces of Hindústan,
until the establishment of the power of
Daulet Ráo Sindíá, when the regular brigades,
commanded by French officers in
the service of that prince, not only checked
their inroads, but made all the Sikh chiefs,
to the southward of the Satléj, acknowledge
obedience and pay tribute to Sindíá: and
it was in the contemplation of General
Perron, had the war with the English
government not occurred, to have subdued
the Penjáb, and made the Indus the limit
of his possession: and every person acquainted
with his means, and with the
condition and resources of the Sikhs, must
be satisfied he would have accomplished
this project with great ease, and at a very
early period.</p>

<p>When Holkár fled into the Penjáb, in
1805, and was pursued by that illustrious
British commander, Lord Lake, a complete
opportunity was given of observing
the actual state of this nation, which was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
found weak and distracted, in a degree
that could hardly have been imagined. It
was altogether destitute of union. And
though a Gúrú-matá, or national council,
was called, with a view to decide on those
means by which they could best avert the
danger by which their country was threatened,
from the presence of the English and
Mahráta armies, it was attended by few
chiefs: and most of the absentees, who had
any power, were bold and forward in their
offers to resist any resolution to which this
council might come. The intrigues and
negotiations of all appeared, indeed, at this
moment, to be entirely directed to objects
of personal resentment, or personal aggrandizement;
and every shadow of that concord,
which once formed the strength of
the Sikh nation, seemed to be extinguished.</p>

the Sikhs, like the Hindús, are inclined to be predestinarians,
and this gives their minds a great tendency to
view accidents as decrees of Providence; and it is
probable that this instance of early good fortune in
Rám Dás, by impressing his countrymen with an idea
of his being particularly favoured of Heaven, gave rise
to an impression that promoted, in no slight degree,
that success which it anticipated.</p></div>

that published by Major Browne, which is,
in general, drawn from authentic sources, appear to be
in error with regard to the period at which this race
first took arms, which the last author states to have
occurred under Gúrú Góvind; but several Sikh authors,
of great respectability and information, agree in
ascribing to the efforts of Har Góvind, the son of
Arjun, this great change in the Sikh commonwealth;
and their correctness, in this point, appears to be placed
beyond all question, by a passage in the Ratnávalí of
B'hai Gúrú Dás B'halé; who observes, "That five phials
(of divine grace) were distributed to five Pírs (holy
men), but the sixth Pír was a mighty Gúrú (priest).
Arjun threw off his earthly frame, and the form
of Har Góvind mounted the seat of authority. The
Sóndi race continued exhibiting their different forms
in their turns. Har Góvind was the destroyer of
armies, a martial Gúrú (priest), a great warrior, and
performed great actions." The mistake of some
European writers on this subject probably originated
in a confusion of verbal accounts; and the similarity
of the name of Har Góvind, the son of Arjunmal, and
Góvínd, the last and greatest of the Sikh Gúrús, the
son of Tégh Bahádur. In the Persian sketch, which
Major Browne translates, the name of Har Góvind is
not mentioned. The son of Arjunmal is called Gúrú
Rám Ráy, which is obviously a mistake of the author
of that manuscript.</p></div>

would appear not to be the fact. Tégh Behádur,
agreeable to them, provoked his execution
by a series of crimes. He joined, they state, with a
Moslem Fakír, of the name of Hafiz ed Dín; and,
supported by a body of armed mendicants, committed
the most violent depredations on the peaceable
inhabitants of the Penjáb. The author of the Seir
Mutákhherin says he was, in consequence of these
excesses, put to death at Gwalior, and his body cut

of cast amongst the Hindús, and to bring them
to the adoration of that Supreme Being, before whom
all men, he contended, were equal. Gúrú Góvind,
who adopted all the principles of his celebrated predecessor,
as far as religious usages were concerned, is
reported to have said, on this subject, that the four
tribes of Hindús, the Bráhmen, Cshatríya, Vaisya,
and Súdra, would, like <i>pán</i> (betle-leaf), <i>chunám</i> (lime),
<i>supári</i> (betle-nut), and <i>khat</i> (<i>terra japonica</i>, or <i>catechu</i>),

to those acquainted with the deep-rooted

that in the year of the Híjerah 1118, Gúrú Góvind,
agreeably to the directions he had received
from two Bráhmen necromancers, threw a number of
magical compounds, given him by these Bráhmens,
into a fire, near which he continued in prayers for
several days. A sword of lightning at last burst from
the flame of fire; but Góvind, instead of seizing this
sword in an undaunted manner, as he was instructed,
was dazzled by its splendour, and shrunk from it
in alarm. The sword instantly flew to heaven; from
whence a loud voice was heard to say, "Gúrú Góvind!
thy wishes shall be fulfilled by thy posterity,
and thy followers shall daily increase." The Bráhmens
were in despair at this failure; but, after deep
reflection, they told Góvind, there was still one mode
of acquiring that honour for himself, which appeared,
by the decree that had been pronounced, doomed for
his posterity. If he would only allow them to take off his
head, and throw it into the fire, he would be resuscitated
to the enjoyment of the greatest glory. The
Gúrú excused himself from trying this experiment,
declaring that he was content that his descendants
should enjoy the fruits of that tree which he had
planted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_39_39" id="Footnote_39_39"></a><a href="#FNanchor_39_39"><span class="label">[39]</span></a> The following short extract from the translation
of the Vichitra Nátac, will show that Góvind gave his
friends their full meed of praise, and will also exhibit
the character of his style: "Cripál rages, wielding his
mace: he crushed the skull of the fierce Hyát
Khán. He made the blood spurt aloft, and scattered
the brains of the chief, as Crishna crushed the
earthen vessel of butter. Then Nand Chand raged
in dreadful ire, launching the spear, and wielding
the sword. He broke his keen scimitar, and drew
his dagger, to support the honour of the Sóndi race.
Then my maternal uncle, Cripál, advanced in his
rage, and exhibited the skilful war-feats of a true
Cshatríya. The mighty warrior, though struck by
an arrow, with another made a valiant Khán fall
from his saddle, and Sáheb Chand, of the Cshatríya
race, strove in the battle's fury, and slew a blood-thirsty
Khán, a warrior of Khorásan." After recording
the actions of many others, Góvind thus describes
his own deeds: "The blood-drinking spectres and
ghosts yelled for carnage; the fierce Vetála, the
chief of the spectres, laughed for joy, and sternly
prepared for his repast. The vultures hovered
around, screaming for their prey. Hari Chand, (a
Hindú chief in the emperor's army,) in his wrath,
drawing his bow, first struck my steed with an
arrow: aiming a second time, he discharged his
arrow; but the Deity preserved me, and it passed
me, and only grazed my ear. His third arrow struck
my breast: it tore open the mail, and pierced the
skin, leaving a slight scar; but the God whom I
adore saved me. When I felt this hurt, my anger
was kindled; I drew my bow and discharged an
arrow: all my champions did the same, rushing
onwards to the battle. Then I aimed at the young
hero, and struck him. Hari Chand perished, and
many of his host; death devoured him, who was
called a Rájá among a hundred thousand Rájás.
Then all the host, struck with consternation, fled,
deserting the field of combat. I obtained the victory
through the favour of the Most High; and,
victorious in the field, we raised aloud the song of
triumph. Riches fell on us like rain, and all our
warriors were glad."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_40_40" id="Footnote_40_40"></a><a href="#FNanchor_40_40"><span class="label">[40]</span></a> Hyát Khán and Nejábet Khán are mentioned as
two of the principal chiefs of the emperor's army that
fell in this first action. Góvind, speaking of the fall
of the latter, says: "When Nejábet Khán fell, the
world exclaimed, Alas! but the region of Swarga
(the heavens) shouted victory."</p></div>

been overrun by the Rájá of Nepál and Gore'ha. I

style sufficiently inflated for the wars of the demons
and angels; yet, as Góvind relates, that Husain Khán
returned a messenger, which one of the principal Rájás
had sent him, with this message to his master; "Pay
down ten thousand rupees, or destruction descends
on thy head;" we may judge, both from the demand,
and the amount of the contribution, of the nature of
this contest, as well as its scale. It was evidently one
of those petty provincial wars, which took place in
every remote part of the Indian empire, when it was
distracted: and, at this period, Aurungzéb was wholly
engaged in the Dek'hin, and the northern provinces
were consequently neglected, and their governments
in a weak and unsettled state.</p></div>

supremacy of the emperor. "God," he says, "formed
both Bábá (Nánac) and Báber (the emperor of that
name). Look upon Bábá as the Pádsháh (king) of
religion, and Báber, the lord of the world. He
who will not give Nánac a single damri, (a coin the
sixteenth part of an ana,) will receive a severe
punishment from Báber."</p></div>

aside the <i>zunár</i>, or holy cord, to which they were, as
belonging to the Cshatríya race, entitled. Speaking
of these youths, the author says: "Slaughtering every
Turk and Pahlan whom they saw, they adorned

the followers of Banda, who totally deny this account

in B'habar, where he quietly ended his days, leaving
two sons, Ajit Singh and Zoráwer Singh, who successfully
propagated his doctrine. This sect chiefly resides

<h2>SECTION II.</h2>


<p>Neither the limits of this sketch, nor
the materials from which it is drawn, will
admit of my giving a particular or correct
account of the countries possessed by the
Sikhs, or of their forms of government,
manners, and habits: but a cursory view of
these subjects may be useful, and may
excite and direct that curiosity which it
cannot expect to gratify.</p>

<p>The country now possessed by the Sikhs,
which reaches from latitude 28° 40' to
beyond latitude 32° N., and includes all the
Penjáb<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>, a small part of Multán, and most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
of that tract of country which lies between
the Jumna and the Satléj, is bounded, to
the northward and westward, by the territories
of the king of Cábul; to the eastward,
by the possessions of the mountaineer
Rájás of Jammu, Nadón, and Srínagar;
and to the southward, by the territories of
the English government, and the sandy
deserts of Jasalmér and Hánsyá Hisár.</p>

<p>The Sikhs, who inhabit the country
between the Satléj and the Jumna, are
called Málawá Singh, and were almost all
converted from the Hindú tribes of Játs
and Gujars. The title of Málawá Singh
was conferred upon them for their extraordinary
gallantry, under the Baírágí Banda,
who is stated to have declared, that the
countries granted to them should be fruitful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
as Málwá, one of the provinces<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> in India.
The principal chiefs among the Málawá
Singhs, are, Sáheb Singh, of Patiálá; B'hangá
Singh, of T'hánésur; B'hág Singh, of Jhind;
and B'hailal Singh, of Keintal. Besides
these, there are several inferior chiefs, such
as Gúrúdah Singh, Jud'h Singh, and Carm
Singh; all of whom have a few villages,
and some horse, and consider themselves
independent; though they, in general, are
content to secure their possessions by attaching
themselves to one or other of the
more powerful leaders.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>
<p>The country of the Málawá Singh is, in
some parts, fruitful: but those districts of
it, which border on Hánsyá and Carnál, are
very barren; being covered with low wood,
and, in many places, almost destitute of
water. Sarhind was formerly the capital of
this country; but it is now a complete ruin,
and has probably never recovered the
dreadful ravages of the Bairágí Banda, who
is stated not only to have destroyed its
mosques, but to have levelled all its palaces
and public buildings with the ground.
Patiálá is now the largest and most flourishing
town of this province, and next to it
T'hánésur, which is still held in high religious
veneration by the Hindús; who have
also a very high reverence for the river
Seraswetí, which flows through this province.
The territories of the chiefs of Málawá
Singh are bounded to the N. W. by
the Satléj; between which and the Béyah,
is the country called the Jaléndra Beit,
or Jaléndra Dúáb; the Sikhs inhabiting
which are called the Dúábá Singh, or the
Singhs who dwell between the rivers<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a>. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
country of Jaléndra Dúáb, which reaches
from the mountains to the junction of the
Satléj and the Béyah, is the most fruitful
of all the possessions of the Sikhs; and is,
perhaps, excelled in climate and vegetation
by no province of India. The soil is light,
but very productive: the country, which is
open and level, abounds with every kind of
grain. That want of water, which is so
much felt in other parts of India, must be
here unknown; as it is found every where
in abundance, within two, or at furthest
three, feet from the surface of the soil. The
towns of Jaléndra and Sultánpúr are the
principal in the Dúáb.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>
<p>The country between the Béyah and
Ráví rivers is called Bári Dúáb, or Mánj'há;
and the Sikhs inhabiting it are called
Mánj'há Singh. The cities of Lahore and
Amritsar are both in this province; and it
becomes, in consequence, the great centre
of the power of this nation. Ranjít Singh,
of Lahore; Fateh Singh<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>, of Alluwál; and
Jud'h Singh, of Rámgadiá<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>; are the principal
chiefs of this country.</p>

<p>The country of Bári is said to be less
fertile, particularly towards the mountains,
than Jaléndra; but, as it lies on the same
level, it must possess nearly the same climate
and soil.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the country between
the Ráví and Chanháb, are called D'harpí
Singh, from the country being called
D'harpí. The D'haníghéb Singh are beyond
the Chanháb<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>, but within the Jéhalam
river.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>The Sind Singh is the term by which the
inhabitants of the districts under the Sikhs,
bordering on the Sind, are known; and
Nakái Singh is the name given to the Sikhs
who reside in Multán. With the leaders of the
Sikhs in these provinces, the extent of their
possessions, or the climate and productions
of the country under their rule, I am little
acquainted. Those in Multán, as well as
those settled on the river Jéhalam, are said
to be constantly engaged in a predatory
warfare, either with the officers of the Afghán
government, or with Muhammedan
chiefs who have jágírs in their vicinity.</p>

<p>The government of the Sikhs, considered
in its theory, may, as has been before
stated, be termed a theocracy. They obey
a temporal chief, it is true; but that chief
preserves his power and authority by professing
himself the servant of the Khálsá<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
or government, which can only be said to
act, in times of great public emergency,
through the means of a national council, of
which every chief is a member, and which
is supposed to deliberate and resolve under
the immediate inspiration and impulse of
an invisible being; who, they believe, always
watches over the interests of the commonwealth.</p>

<p>The nature of the power established by
the temporal chiefs of the Sikhs, has been
sufficiently explained in the narrative of
their history. It will be necessary, before
any account is given of the forms and
actions of their Gúrú-matá, or great national
council, which is intended to have a supreme
authority over their federative republic,
to take a view of that body of
Acálís, or immortals, who, under the double
character of fanatic priests and desperate
soldiers, have usurped the sole direction of
all religious affairs at Amritsar, and are,
consequently, leading men in a council
which is held at that sacred place, and
which deliberates under all the influence of
religious enthusiasm.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>
<p>The Acálís<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> are a class of Sikh devotees;
who, agreeably to the historians of that
nation, were first founded by Gúrú Góvind,
whose institutes, as it has been before stated,
they most zealously defended against the
innovations of the Bairágí Banda. They
wear blue chequered clothes, and bangles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
or bracelets of steel<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>, round their wrists,
initiate converts, and have almost the sole
direction of the religious ceremonies at Amritsar,
where they reside, and of which they
deem themselves the defenders; and, consequently,
never desire to quit it unless in
cases of great extremity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>This order of Sikhs have a place, or
Bungá<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>, on the bank of the sacred reservoir
of Amritsar, where they generally resort,
but are individually possessed of property,
though they affect poverty, and subsist upon
charity; which, however, since their numbers
have increased, they generally extort,
by accusing the principal chiefs of crimes,
imposing fines upon them; and, in the
event of their refusing to pay, preventing
them from performing their ablutions, or
going through any of their religious ceremonies
at Amritsar.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>It will not, when the above circumstances
are considered, be thought surprising, that
the most powerful of the Sikh chiefs should
desire to conciliate this body of fanatics, no
individual of which can be offended with
impunity, as the cause of one is made the
cause of the whole; and a chief, who is
become unpopular with the Acálís, must
not only avoid Amritsar, but is likely to
have his dependants taught, when they pay
their devotions at that place, that it is
pious to resist his authority.</p>

<p>The Acálís have a great interest in maintaining
both the religion and government of
the Sikhs, as established by Gúrú Góvind;
as, on its continuance in that shape, their
religious and political influence must depend.
Should Amritsar cease to be a place
of resort, or be no longer considered as the
religious capital of the state, in which all
questions that involve the general interests
of the commonwealth are to be decided,
this formidable order would at once fall
from that power and consideration which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
they now possess, to a level with other
mendicants.</p>

<p>When a Gúrú-matá, or great national
council, is called, (as it always is, or ought
to be, when any imminent danger threatens
the country, or any large expedition is to
be undertaken,) all the Sikh chiefs assemble
at Amritsar. The assembly, which is called
the Gúrú-matá, is convened by the Acálís;
and when the chiefs meet upon this solemn
occasion, it is concluded that all private
animosities cease, and that every man sacrifices
his personal feelings at the shrine of
the general good; and, actuated by principles
of pure patriotism, thinks of nothing
but the interests of the religion, and commonwealth,
to which he belongs.</p>

<p>When the chiefs and principal leaders
are seated, the Adí-Grant'h and Dasama
Pádsháh ká Grant'h are placed before them.
They all bend their heads before these scriptures,
and exclaim, <i>Wá! Gúrúji ká Khálsa!
Wá! Gúrúji ki Fateh!</i> A great quantity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
cakes, made of wheat, butter, and sugar,
are then placed before the volumes of their
sacred writings, and covered with a cloth.
These holy cakes, which are in commemoration
of the injunction of Nánac, to eat
and to give to others to eat, next receive
the salutation of the assembly, who then
rise, and the Acálís pray aloud, while the
musicians play. The Acálís, when the
prayers are finished, desire the council to
be seated. They sit down, and the cakes
being uncovered, are eaten of by all classes<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
of Sikhs: those distinctions of original
tribes, which are, on other occasions, kept
up, being on this occasion laid aside, in
token of their general and complete union<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
in one cause<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>. The Acálís then exclaim:
"Sirdars! (chiefs) this is a Gúrú-matá!"
on which prayers are again said aloud.
The chiefs, after this, sit closer, and say to
each other: "The sacred Grant'h is betwixt
us, let us swear by our scripture to forget
all internal disputes, and to be united."
This moment of religious fervor and ardent
patriotism, is taken to reconcile all animosities.
They then proceed to consider
the danger with which they are threatened,
to settle the best plans for averting it, and
to choose the generals who are to lead their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
armies<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> against the common enemy. The
first Gúrú-matá was assembled by Gúrú
Góvind; and the latest was called in 1805,
when the British army pursued Holkár into
the Penjáb.</p>

<p>The principal chiefs of the Sikhs are all
descended from Hindú tribes. There is,
indeed, no instance of a Singh of a Muhammedan
family attaining high power<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>:
a circumstance to be accounted for from
the hatred still cherished, by the followers
of Gúrú Góvind, against the descendants of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
his persecutors: and that this rancorous
spirit is undiminished, may be seen from
their treatment of the wretched Muhammedans
who yet remain in their territories.
These, though very numerous, appear to be
all poor, and to be an oppressed, despised
race. They till the ground, and are employed
to carry burdens, and to do all kinds
of hard labour: they are not allowed to eat
beef, or to say their prayers aloud, and but
seldom assemble in their mosques<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>; of
which few, indeed, have escaped destruction.
The lower order of Sikhs are more
happy: they are protected from the tyranny
and violence of the chiefs, under whom
they live, by the precepts of their common
religion, and by the condition of their country,
which enables them to abandon, whenever
they choose, a leader whom they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
dislike; and the distance of a few miles
generally places them under the protection
of his rival and enemy. It is from this
cause that the lowest Sikh horseman usually
assumes a very independent style, and the
highest chief treats his military followers
with attention and conciliation. The civil
officers,&mdash;to whom the chiefs intrust their
accounts, and the management of their
property and revenue concerns, as well as
the conduct of their negotiations,&mdash;are, in
general, Sikhs of the Khalása cast; who,
being followers of Nánac, and not of Gúrú
Góvind, are not devoted to arms, but educated
for peaceful occupations, in which
they often become very expert and intelligent.</p>

<p>In the collection of the revenue in the
Penjáb it is stated to be a general rule,
that the chiefs, to whom the territories
belong, should receive one half of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
produce<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>, and the farmer the other: but the
chief never levies the whole of his share:
and in no country, perhaps, is the Rayat,
or cultivator, treated with more indulgence.
Commerce is not so much encouraged;
heavy duties are levied upon it by all petty
rulers through whose districts it passes:
and this, added to the distracted state in
which the Penjáb has been, from the internal
disputes of its possessors, caused the rich
produce of Cásmír to be carried to India
by the difficult and mountainous tract of
Jammu, Nadón, and Srínagar. The Sikh
chiefs have, however, discovered the injury
which their interests have suffered from this
cause, and have endeavoured, and not without
success, to restore confidence to the
merchant; and great part of the shawl trade
now flows through the cities of Lahore,
Amritsar, and Patiálá, to Hindústan.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>
<p>The administration of justice in the countries
under the Sikhs, is in a very rude and
imperfect state; for, though their scriptures
inculcate general maxims of justice, they
are not considered, as the Old Testament
is by the Jews, or the Korán by the Muhammedans,
as books of law: and, having
no fixed code, they appear to have adopted
that irregular practice, which is most congenial
to the temper of the people, and
best suited to the unsteady and changing
character of their rule of government. The
following appears to be the general outline
of their practice in the administration of
justice.</p>

<p>Trifling disputes about property are settled
by the heads of the village, by arbitration<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>,
or by the chiefs. Either of these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
modes, supposing the parties consent to
refer to it, is final; and they must agree to
one or other. If a theft occurs, the property
is recovered, and the party punished
by the person from whom it was stolen,
who is aided on such occasions by the inhabitants
of his village, or his chief. The
punishment, however, is never capital<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>.
Murder is generally revenged by the relations
of the deceased, who, in such cases,
rigorously retaliate on the murderer, and
often on all who endeavour to protect
him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>The character of the Sikhs, or rather
Singhs, which is the name by which the
followers of Gúrú Góvind, who are all
devoted to arms, are distinguished, is very
marked. They have, in general, the Hindú
cast of countenance, somewhat altered by
their long beards, and are to the full as
active as the Mahrátas; and much more
robust, from their living fuller, and enjoying
a better and colder climate. Their courage
is equal, at all times, to that of any natives
of India; and when wrought upon by prejudice
or religion, is quite desperate. They
are all horsemen, and have no infantry in
their own country, except for the defence
of their forts and villages, though they generally
serve as infantry in foreign armies.
They are bold, and rather rough, in their
address; which appears more to a stranger
from their invariably speaking in a loud tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
of voice: but this is quite a habit, and is
alike used by them to express the sentiments
of regard and hatred. The Sikhs
have been reputed deceitful and cruel; but
I know no grounds upon which they can
be considered more so than the other tribes
of India. They seemed to me, from all the
intercourse I had with them, to be more
open and sincere than the Mahrátas, and
less rude and savage than the Afgháns.
They have, indeed, become, from national
success, too proud of their own strength,
and too irritable in their tempers, to have
patience for the wiles of the former; and
they retain, in spite of their change of manners
and religion, too much of the original<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
character of their Hindú ancestors, (for the
great majority are of the Hindú race,) to
have the constitutional ferocity of the latter.
The Sikh soldier is, generally speaking,
brave, active, and cheerful, without polish,
but neither destitute of sincerity nor attachment;
and if he often appears wanting in
humanity, it is not so much to be attributed
to his national character, as to the habits of
a life, which, from the condition of the
society in which he is born, is generally
passed in scenes of violence and rapine.</p>

<p>The Sikh merchant, or cultivator of the
soil, if he is a Singh, differs little in character
from the soldier, except that his occupation
renders him less presuming and
boisterous. He also wears arms, and is,
from education, prompt to use them whenever
his individual interest, or that of the
community in which he lives<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>, requires him
to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span> do so. The general occupations of the
Khalása Sikhs has been before mentioned.
Their character differs widely from that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the Singhs. Full of intrigue, pliant, versatile,
and insinuating, they have all the art of the
lower classes of Hindús, who are usually
employed in transacting business: from
whom, indeed, as they have no distinction
of dress, it is very difficult to distinguish
them.</p>

<p>The religious tribes of Acálís, Shahíd,
and Nirmala, have been noticed. Their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
general character is formed from their habits
of life. The Acálís are insolent, ignorant,
and daring: presuming upon those rights
which their numbers and fanatic courage
have established, their deportment is hardly
tolerant to the other Sikhs, and insufferable
to strangers, for whom they entertain a
contempt, which they take little pains to
conceal. The Sháhíd and the Nirmala,
particularly the latter, have more knowledge,
and more urbanity. They are almost
all men of quiet, peaceable habits; and
many of them are said to possess learning.</p>

<p>There is another tribe among the Sikhs,
called the Nánac Pautra, or descendants of
Nánac, who have the character of being a
mild, inoffensive race; and, though they do
not acknowledge the institutions of Gúrú
Góvind, they are greatly revered by his
followers, who hold it sacrilege to injure the
race of their founder; and, under the
advantage which this general veneration affords
them, the Nánac Pautra pursue their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
occupations; which, if they are not mendicants,
is generally that of travelling merchants.
They do not carry arms; and profess,
agreeably to the doctrine of Nánac, to
be at peace<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> with all mankind.</p>

<p>The Sikh converts, it has been before
stated, continue, after they have quitted
their original religion, all those civil usages
and customs of the tribes to which they
belonged, that they can practise, without
infringing the tenets of Nánac, or the institutions
of Gúrú Góvind. They are most particular
with regard to their intermarriages;
and, on this point, Sikhs descended from
Hindús almost invariably conform to Hindú
customs, every tribe intermarrying within<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
itself. The Hindú usage, regarding diet, is
also held equally sacred; no Sikh, descended
from a Hindú family, ever violating it, except
upon particular occasions, such as a
Gúrú-matá, when they are obliged, by their
tenets and institutions, to eat promiscuously.
The strict observance of these usages has
enabled many of the Sikhs, particularly of
the Ját<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> and Gujar<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> tribes, which include
almost all those settled to the south of the
Satléj, to preserve an intimate intercourse
with their original tribes; who, considering
the Sikhs not as having lost cast, but as
Hindús that have joined a political association,
which obliges them to conform to
general rules established for its preservation,
neither refuse to intermarry<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> nor to eat with
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The higher cast of Hindús, such as Bráhmens
and Cshatríyas, who have become
Sikhs, continue to intermarry with converts
of their own tribes, but not with Hindús of
the cast they have abandoned, as they are
polluted by eating animal food; all kinds
of which are lawful to Sikhs, except the
cow, which it is held sacrilege to slay<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.
Nánac, whose object was to conciliate the
Muhammedans to his creed, prohibited
hog's flesh also; but it was introduced by
his successors, as much, perhaps, from a
spirit of revenge against the Moslems, as
from considerations of indulgence to the
numerous converts of the Ját and Gujar
tribe, among whom wild hog is a favourite
species of food.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>
<p>The Muhammedans, who become Sikhs,
intermarry with each other, but are allowed
to preserve none of their usages, being
obliged to eat hog's flesh, and abstain from
circumcision.</p>

<p>The Sikhs are forbid the use of tobacco<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a>,
but allowed to indulge in spirituous<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
liquors, which they almost all drink to
excess; and it is rare to see a Singh soldier,
after sunset, quite sober. Their drink is an
ardent spirit<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>, made in the Penjáb; but
they have no objections to either the wine
or spirits of Europe, when they can obtain
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>The use of opium, to intoxicate, is very
common with the Sikhs, as with most of the
military tribes of India. They also take
B'hang<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>, another inebriating drug.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>The conduct of the Sikhs to their women
differs in no material respect from that of
the tribes of Hindús, or Muhammedans,
from whom they are descended. Their
moral character with regard to women, and
indeed in most other points, may, from the
freedom of their habits, generally be considered
as much more lax than that of their
ancestors, who lived under the restraint of
severe restrictions, and whose fear of excommunication
from their cast, at least
obliged them to cover their sins with the
veil of decency. This the emancipated
Sikhs despise: and there is hardly an infamy
which this debauched and dissolute
race are not accused (and I believe with
justice) of committing in the most open
and shameful manner.</p>

<p>The Sikhs are almost all horsemen, and
they take great delight in riding. Their
horses were, a few years ago, famous; and
those bred in the Lak'hi Jungle, and other
parts of their territory, were justly celebrated
for their strength, temper, and activity:
but the internal distractions of these
territories has been unfavourable to the
encouragement of the breed, which has
consequently declined; and the Sikhs now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
are in no respect better mounted than
the Mahrátas. From a hundred of their
cavalry it would be difficult to select ten
horses that would be admitted as fit to
mount native troopers in the English
service.</p>

<p>Their horsemen use swords and spears,
and most of them now carry matchlocks,
though some still use the bow and arrow; a
species of arms, for excellence in the use of
which their forefathers were celebrated, and
which their descendants appear to abandon
with great reluctance.</p>

<p>The education of the Sikhs renders them
hardy, and capable of great fatigue; and
the condition of the society in which they
live, affords constant exercise to that restless
spirit of activity and enterprise which their
religion has generated. Such a race cannot
be epicures: they appear, indeed, generally
to despise luxury of diet, and pride
themselves in their coarse fare. Their dress
is also plain, not unlike that of the Hindús,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
equally light and divested of ornament.
Some of the chiefs wear gold bangles; but
this is rare; and the general characteristic of
their dress and mode of living, is simplicity.</p>

<p>The principal leaders among the Sikhs
affect to be familiar and easy of intercourse
with their inferiors, and to despise the pomp
and state of the Muhammedan chiefs: but
their pride often counteracts this disposition;
and they appeared to me to have,
in proportion to their rank and consequence,
more state, and to maintain equal,
if not more, reserve and dignity with their
followers, than is usual with the Mahráta
chiefs.</p>

<p>It would be difficult, if not impracticable,
to ascertain the amount of the population
of the Sikh territories, or even to compute
the number of the armies which they could
bring into action. They boast that they
can raise more than a hundred thousand
horse: and, if it were possible to assemble
every Sikh horseman, this statement might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
not be an exaggeration: but there is, perhaps,
no chief among them, except Ranjít
Singh, of Lahore, that could bring an effective
body of four thousand men into the
field. The force of Ranjít Singh did not,
in 1805, amount to eight thousand; and
part of that was under chiefs who had been
subdued from a state of independence, and
whose turbulent minds ill brooked an usurpation
which they deemed subversive of the
constitution of their commonwealth. His
army is now more numerous than it was,
but it is composed of materials which have
no natural cohesion; and the first serious
check which it meets, will probably cause
its dissolution.</p>

bawls a secret in your ear. It has often occurred to
me, that they have acquired it from living in a country
where internal disputes have so completely destroyed
confidence, that they can only carry on conversation
with each other at a distance: but it is fairer, perhaps,
to impute this boisterous and rude habit to their living
almost constantly in a camp, in which the voice certainly
loses that nice modulated tone which distinguishes

village, where his wealth, courage, or experience,
always obtains him respect, and sometimes station and
consequence. The second march which the British
army made into the country of the Sikhs, the headquarters
were near a small village, the chief of which,
who was upwards of a hundred years of age, had been
a soldier, and retained all the look and manner of his
former occupation. He came to me, and expressed
his anxiety to see Lord Lake. I showed him the
general, who was sitting alone, in his tent, writing. He
smiled, and said he knew better: "The hero who had
overthrown Sindiá and Holkár, and had conquered
Hindústan, must be surrounded with attendants, and
have plenty of persons to write for him." I assured
him that it was Lord Lake; and, on his lordship
coming to breakfast, I introduced the old Singh, who
seeing a number of officers collect round him, was at
last satisfied of the truth of what I said; and, pleased
with the great kindness and condescension with which
he was treated by one whom he justly thought so
great a man, sat down on the carpet, became quite
talkative, and related all he had seen, from the invasion
of Nádir Sháh to that moment. Lord Lake,
pleased with the bold manliness of his address, and the
independence of his sentiments, told him he would
grant him any favour he wished. "I am glad of it,"
said the old man; "then march away with your army
from my village, which will otherwise be destroyed."
Lord Lake, struck with the noble spirit of the request,
assured him he would march next morning, and that,
in the mean-time, he should have guards, who would
protect his village from injury. Satisfied with this
assurance, the old Singh was retiring, apparently full
of admiration and gratitude at Lord Lake's goodness,
and of wonder at the scene he had witnessed, when,
meeting two officers at the door of the tent, he put a
hand upon the breast of each, exclaiming at the same
time, "<i>Brothers! where were you born, and where are
you at this moment?</i>" and, without waiting for an
answer, proceeded to his village.</p></div>

general protection was requested, by several principal
chiefs, for the Nánac Pautra, on the ground of the
veneration in which they were held, which enabled
them, it was stated, to travel all over the country without
molestation, even when the most violent wars
existed. It was, of course, granted.</p></div>

also an authority, quoted by the Sikhs, from the Hindú

liquor inspires courage; and this goddess, they say,

it; and B'hág Singh, an old chief, of frank, rough manners,

<h2>SECTION III.</h2>


<p>There is no branch of this sketch which
is more curious and important, or that
offers more difficulties to the inquirer, than
the religion of the Sikhs. We meet with a
creed of pure deism, grounded on the most
sublime general truths, blended with the
belief of all the absurdities of the Hindú
mythology, and the fables of Muhammedanism;
for Nánac professed a desire to
reform, not to destroy, the religion of the
tribe in which he was born; and, actuated
by the great and benevolent design of
reconciling the jarring faiths of Brahmá and
Muhammed, he endeavoured to conciliate
both Hindús and Moslems to his doctrine,
by persuading them to reject those parts of
their respective beliefs and usages, which,
he contended, were unworthy of that God<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
whom they both adored. He called upon
the Hindús to abandon the worship of idols,
and to return to that pure devotion of the
Deity, in which their religion originated.
He called upon the Muhammedans to abstain
from practices, like the slaughter of
cows, that were offensive to the religion of
the Hindús, and to cease from the persecution
of that race. He adopted, in order
to conciliate them, many of the maxims
which he had learnt from mendicants, who
professed the principles of the Súfi sect;
and he constantly referred to the admired
writings of the celebrated Muhammedan
Kabír<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>, who was a professed Súfi, and who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
inculcated the doctrine of the equality of
the relation of all created beings to their
Creator. Nánac endeavoured, with all the
power of his own genius, aided by such
authorities, to impress both Hindús and
Muhammedans with a love of toleration
and an abhorrence of war; and his life was
as peaceable as his doctrine. He appears,
indeed, to have adopted, from the hour in
which he abandoned his worldly occupations
to that of his death, the habits
practised by that crowd of holy mendicants,
Sanyásís and Fakírs, with whom India
swarms. He conformed to their customs;
and his extraordinary austerities<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> are a
constant theme of praise with his followers.
His works are all in praise of God; but he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
treats the polytheism of the Hindús with
respect, and even veneration. He never
shows a disposition to destroy the fabric,
but only wishes to divest it of its useless
tinsel and false ornaments, and to establish
its complete dependence upon the great
Creator of the universe. He speaks every
where of Muhammed, and his successors,
with moderation; but animadverts boldly
on what he conceives to be their errors;
and, above all, on their endeavours to propagate
their faith by the sword.</p>

<p>As Nánac made no material invasion of
either the civil or religious usages of the
Hindús, and as his only desire was to restore
a nation who had degenerated from
their original pure worship<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> into idolatry,
he may be considered more in the light of a
reformer than of a subverter of the Hindú<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
religion; and those Sikhs who adhere to his
tenets, without admitting those of Gúrú
Góvind, are hardly to be distinguished from
the great mass of Hindú population; among
whom there are many sects who differ,
much more than that of Nánac, from the
general and orthodox worship at present
established in India.</p>

<p>The first successors of Nánac appear to
have taught exactly the same doctrine as
their leader; and though Har Góvind
armed all his followers, it was on a principle
of self-defence, in which he was fully
justified, even by the usage of the Hindús.
It was reserved for Gúrú Góvind to give a
new character to the religion of his followers;
not by making any material alteration
in the tenets of Nánac, but by establishing
institutions and usages, which not
only separated them from other Hindús,
but which, by the complete abolition of all
distinction of casts, destroyed, at one blow,
a system of civil polity, that, from being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
interwoven with the religion of a weak and
bigoted race, fixed the rule of its priests
upon a basis that had withstood the shock
of ages. Though the code of the Hindús
was calculated to preserve a vast community
in tranquillity and obedience to its
rulers, it had the natural effect of making
the country, in which it was established, an
easy conquest to every powerful foreign
invader; and it appears to have been the
contemplation of this effect that made Gúrú
Góvind resolve on the abolition of cast, as
a necessary and indispensable prelude to
any attempt to arm the original native
population of India against their foreign
tyrants. He called upon all Hindús to
break those chains in which prejudice and
bigotry had bound them, and to devote
themselves to arms, as the only means by
which they could free themselves from the
oppressive government of the Muhammedans;
against whom, a sense of his own
wrongs, and those of his tribe, led him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
preach eternal warfare. His religious doctrine
was meant to be popular, and it
promised equality. The invidious appellations
of Bráhmen, Cshatríya, Vaisya, and
Súdra, were abolished. The pride of descent
might remain, and keep up some distinctions;
but, in the religious code of Góvind,
every Khálsa Singh (for such he termed his
followers) was equal, and had a like title to
the good things of this world, and to the
blessings of a future life.</p>

<p>Though Gúrú Góvind mixes, even more
than Nánac, the mythology of the Hindús
with his own tenets; though his desire
to conciliate them, in opposition to the
Muhammedans, against whom he always
breathed war and destruction, led him to
worship at Hindú sacred shrines; and
though the peculiar customs and dress
among his followers, are stated to have been
adopted from veneration to the Hindú goddess
of courage, Dúrga Bhavání; yet it is
impossible to reconcile the religion and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
usages, which Góvind has established, with
the belief of the Hindús. It does not, like
that of Nánac, question some favourite
dogmas of the disciples of Brahmá, and
attack that worship of idols, which few of
these defend, except upon the ground of
these figures, before which they bend, being
symbolical representations of the attributes
of an all-powerful Divinity; but it proceeds
at once to subvert the foundation of the
whole system. Wherever the religion of
Gúrú Góvind prevails, the institutions of
Brahmá must fall. The admission of proselytes,
the abolition of the distinctions of
cast, the eating of all kinds of flesh, except
that of cows, the form of religious worship,
and the general devotion of all Singhs to
arms, are ordinances altogether irreconcileable
with Hindú mythology, and have rendered
the religion of the Sikhs as obnoxious
to the Bráhmens, and higher tribes of the
Hindús, as it is popular with the lower
orders of that numerous class of mankind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>After this rapid sketch of the general
character of the religion of the Sikhs, I
shall take a more detailed view of its origin,
progress, tenets, and forms.</p>

<p>A Sikh author<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>, whom I have followed
in several parts of this sketch, is very particular
in stating the causes of the origin of
the religion of Nánac: he describes the
different Yugas, or ages of the world, stated
in the Hindú mythology. The Cáli Yug,
which is the present, is that in which it was
written that the human race would become
completely depraved: "Discord," says the
author, speaking of the Cáli Yug, "will
rise in the world, sin prevail, and the
universe become wicked; cast will contend
with cast; and, like bamboos in
friction, consume each other to embers.
The Védas, or scriptures," he adds, "will
be held in disrepute, for they shall not
be understood, and the darkness of ignorance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
will prevail every where." Such is
this author's record of a divine prophecy
regarding this degenerate age. He proceeds
to state what has ensued: "Every one followed
his own path, and sects were
separated; some worshipped Chandra
(the moon); some Surya (the sun); some
prayed to the earth, to the sky, and the
air, and the water, and the fire, while
others worshipped D'herma Rájá (the
judge of the dead); and in the fallacy of
the sects nothing was to be found but
error. In short, pride prevailed in the
world, and the four casts<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> established a
system of ascetic devotion. From these,
the ten sects of Sanyásís, and the twelve
sects of Yógis, originated. The Jangam,
the Srívíra, and the Déva Digambar,
entered into mutual contests. The Bráhmens
divided into different classes; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
the Sástras, Védas, and Puránas<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>, contradicted
each other. The six Dersans
(philosophical sects) exhibited enmity,
and the thirty-six Páshands (heterodox
sects) arose, with hundreds of thousands
of chimerical and magical (<i>tantra mantra</i>)
sects: and thus, from one form, many
good and many evil forms originated,
and error prevailed in the Cáli Yug,
or age of general depravity."</p>

<p>The Sikh author pursues this account
of the errors into which the Hindús fell,
with a curious passage regarding the
origin and progress of the Muhammedan
religion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>"The world," he writes, "went on with
these numerous divisions, when Muhammed
Yara<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> appeared, who gave origin
to the seventy-two sects<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>, and widely
disseminated discord and war. He established
the Rózeh o Aíd (fast and festivals),
and the Namáz (prayer), and
made his practice of devotional acts prevalent
in the world, with a multitude of
distinctions, of Pír (saint), Paighamber
(prophet), Ulemá (the order of priesthood),
and Kitàb (the Korán). He demolished
the temples, and on their ruins
built the mosques, slaughtering cows
and helpless persons, and spreading transgression
far and wide, holding in hostility
Cáfirs (infidels), Mulhids (idolaters), Irmenis
(Armenians), Rumis (the Turks),
and Zingis (Ethiopians). Thus vice
greatly diffused itself in the universe."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then," this author adds, "there were
two races in the world; the one Hindú,
the other Muhammedan; and both were
alike excited by pride, enmity, and avarice,
to violence. The Hindús set their
heart on Gangá and Benares; the Muhammedans
on Mecca and the Cáaba:
the Hindús clung to their mark on the
forehead and brahminical string; the
Moslemans to their circumcision: the
one cried Rám (the name of an Avatár),
the other Rahím (the merciful); one
name, but two ways of pronouncing it;
forgetting equally the Védas and the
Korán: and through the deceptions of
lust, avarice, the world, and Satan, they
swerved equally from the true path:
while Bráhmens and Moulavis destroyed
each other by their quarrels, and the
vicissitudes of life and death hung always
suspended over their heads.</p>

<p>"When the world was in this distracted
state, and vice prevailed," says this writer,
"the complaint of virtue, whose dominion
was extinct, reached the throne of the
Almighty, who created Nánac, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
enlighten and improve a degenerate and
corrupt age: and that holy man made
God the Supreme known to all, giving
the nectareous water that washed his feet
to his disciples to drink. He restored to
Virtue her strength, blended the four
casts<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> into one, established one mode of
salutation, changed the childish play of
bending the head at the feet of idols,
taught the worship of the true God, and
reformed a depraved world."</p>

<p>Nánac appears, by the account of this
author, to have established his fame for
sanctity by the usual modes of religious
mendicants. He performed severe Tapasa<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>,
living upon sand and swallow-wort, and
sleeping on sharp pebbles; and, after attaining
fame by this kind of penance, he
commenced his travels, with the view of
spreading his doctrine over the earth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>After Nánac had completed his terrestrial
travels, he is supposed to have ascended
to Suméru, where he saw the
Sidd'his<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>, all seated in a circle. These,
from a knowledge of that eminence for
which he was predestined, wished to make
him assume the characteristic devotion of
their sect, to which they thought he would
be an ornament. While means were used
to effect this purpose, a divine voice was
heard to exclaim: "Nánac shall form his
own sect, distinct from all the Yatís<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
and Sidd'his; and his name shall be
joyful to the Cáli Yug." After this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
Nánac preached the adoration of the true
God to the Hindús; and then went to
instruct the Muhammedans, in their sacred
temples at Mecca. When at that place,
the holy men are said to have gathered
round him, and demanded, Whether their
faith, or that of the Hindús, was the best?
"Without the practice of true piety, both,"
said Nánac, "are erroneous, and neither
Hindús nor Moslems will be acceptable
before the throne of God; for the faded
tinge of scarlet, that has been soiled by
water, will never return. You both deceive
yourselves, pronouncing aloud Rám
and Rahím, and the way of Satan prevails
in the universe."</p>

<p>The courageous independence with which
Nánac announced his religion to the Muhammedans,
is a favourite topic with his
biographers. He was one day abused, and
even struck, as one of these relates, by a
Moullah, for lying on the ground with his
feet in the direction of the sacred temple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
Mecca. "How darest thou, infidel!" said
the offended Muhammedan priest, "turn
thy feet towards the house of God!"&mdash;"Turn
them, if you can," said the pious
but indignant Nánac, "in a direction where
the house of God is not."</p>

<p>Nánac did not deny the mission of Muhammed.
"That prophet was sent," he
said, "by God, to this world, to do good,
and to disseminate the knowledge of one
God through means of the Korán; but
he, acting on the principle of free-will,
which all human beings exercise, introduced
oppression, and cruelty, and the
slaughter of cows<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a>, for which he died.&mdash;I
am now sent," he added, "from heaven,
to publish unto mankind a book, which
shall reduce all the names given unto
God to one name, which is God; and he
who calls him by any other, shall fall into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
the path of the devil, and have his feet
bound in the chains of wretchedness.
You have," said he to the Muhammedans,
"despoiled the temples, and burnt
the sacred Védas, of the Hindús; and
you have dressed yourselves in dresses of
blue, and you delight to have your
praises sung from house to house: but I,
who have seen all the world, tell you,
that the Hindús equally hate you and
your mosques. I am sent to reconcile
your jarring faiths, and I implore you to
read their scriptures, as well as your own:
but reading is useless without obedience
to the doctrine taught; for God has
said, no man shall be saved except he
has performed good works. The Almighty
will not ask to what tribe or
persuasion he belongs. He will only
ask, What has he done? Therefore those
violent and continued disputes, which
subsist between the Hindús and Moslemans,
are as impious as they are unjust."</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>
<p>Such were the doctrines, according to
his disciples, which Nánac taught to both
Hindús and Muhammedans. He professed
veneration and respect, but refused adoration
to the founders of both their religions;
for which, as for those of all other tribes, he
had great tolerance. "A hundred thousand
of Muhammeds," said Nánac, "a million
of Brahmás, Vishnus, and a hundred
thousand Rámas, stand at the gate of the
Most High. These all perish; God alone
is immortal. Yet men, who unite in
the praise of God, are not ashamed
of living in contention with each other;
which proves that the evil spirit has
subdued all. He alone is a true Hindú
whose heart is just; and he only is
a good Muhammedan whose life is
pure."</p>

<p>Nánac is stated, by the Sikh author from
whom the above account of his religion is
taken, to have had an interview with the
supreme God, which he thus describes:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
"One day Nánac heard a voice from
above exclaim, Nánac, approach!" He
replied, "Oh God! what power have I to
stand in thy presence?" The voice said,
"Close thine eyes." Nánac shut his eyes,
and advanced: he was told to look up: he
did so, and heard the word <i>Wá!</i> or <i>well
done</i>, pronounced five times; and then <i>Wá!
Gúrújí</i>, or <i>well done teacher</i>. After this
God said, "Nánac! I have sent thee into
the world, in the Cáli Yug (or depraved
age); go and bear my name." Nánac
said, "Oh God! how can I bear the mighty
burthen? If my age was extended to
tens of millions of years, if I drank of
immortality, and my eyes were formed of
the sun and moon, and were never closed,
still, oh God! I could not presume to
take charge of thy wondrous name."&mdash;"I
will be thy Gúrú (teacher)," said God,
"and thou shalt be a Gúrú to all mankind,
and thy sect shall be great in the world;
their word is Púrí Púrí. The word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
of the Bairágí is Rám! Rám! that of the
Sanyásí, Om! Namá! Náráyen! and the
word of the Yógís, Adés! Adés! and the
salutation of the Muhammedans is Salám
Alíkam; and that of the Hindús, Rám!
Rám! but the word of thy sect shall be
Gúrú, and I will forgive the crimes of
thy disciples. The place of worship of
the Bairágís is called Rámsála; that of
the Yógís, Asan; that of the Sanyásís,
Mát; that of thy tribe shall be Dherma
Sála. Thou must teach unto thy followers
three lessons: the first, to worship
my name; the second, charity; the third,
ablution. They must not abandon the
world, and they must do ill to no being;
for into every being have I infused breath;
and whatever I am, thou art, for betwixt
us there is no difference. It is a blessing
that thou art sent into the Cáli Yug."
After this, "<i>Wá Gúrú!</i> or <i>well done,
teacher!</i> was pronounced from the mouth
of the most high Gúrú or teacher (God),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
and Nánac came to give light and freedom
to the universe."</p>

<p>The above will give a sufficient view of
the ideas which the Sikhs entertain regarding
the divine origin of their faith; which,
as first taught by Nánac, might justly be
deemed the religion of peace.</p>

<p>"Put on armour," says Nánac, "that
will harm no one; let thy coat of mail
be that of understanding, and convert
thy enemies to friends. Fight with valour,
but with no weapon except the
word of God." All the principles which
Nánac inculcated, were those of pure deism;
but moderated, in order to meet the deep-rooted
usages of that portion of mankind
which he wished to reclaim from error.
Though he condemned the lives and habits
of the Muhammedans, he approved of the
Korán<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>. He admitted the truth of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
ancient Védas, but contended that the
Hindú religion had been corrupted, by the
introduction of a plurality of gods, with
the worship of images; which led their
minds astray from that great and eternal
Being, to whom adoration should alone be
paid. He, however, followed the forms of
the Hindús, and adopted most of their doctrines
which did not interfere with his great
and leading tenet. He admitted the claim
to veneration, of the numerous catalogue of
Hindú Dévas, and Dévatás, or inferior
deities; but he refused them adoration. He
held it impious to slaughter the cow; and he
directed his votaries, as has been seen, to
consider ablution as one of their primary
religious duties.</p>

<p>Nánac, according to Penjábi authors,
admitted the Hindú doctrine of metempsychosis.
He believed, that really good men
would enjoy Paradise; that those, who had
no claim to the name of good, but yet were
not bad, would undergo another probation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
by revisiting the world in the human form:
and that the bad would animate the bodies
of animals, particularly dogs and cats: but
it appears, from the same authorities, that
Nánac was acquainted with the Muhammedan
doctrine regarding the fall of man,
and a future state; and that he represented
it to his followers as a system, in which
God, by showing a heaven and a hell, had, in
his great goodness, held out future rewards
and punishments to man, whose will he
had left free, to incite him to good actions,
and deter him from bad. The principle of
reward and punishment is so nearly the same
in the Hindú and in the Muhammedan religion,
that it was not difficult for Nánac to
reconcile his followers upon this point: but
in this, as in all others, he seems to have
bent to the doctrine of Brahmá. In all his
writings, however, he borrowed indifferently
from the Korán and the Hindú Sástras;
and his example was followed by his successors;
and quotations from the scriptures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
of the Hindús, and from the book of Muhammed,
are indiscriminately introduced
into all their sacred writings, to elucidate
those points on which it was their object to
reconcile these jarring religions.</p>

<p>With the exact mode in which Nánac
instructed his followers to address their
prayers to that supreme Being whom he
taught them to adore, I am not acquainted.
Their D'herma Sála, or temples of worship,
are, in general, plain buildings. Images
are, of course, banished. Their prescribed
forms of prayer are, I believe, few and
simple. Part of the writings of Nánac,
which have since been incorporated with
those of his successors, in the Adí-Grant'h,
are read, or rather recited, upon every
solemn occasion. These are all in praise of
the Deity, of religion, and of virtue; and
against impiety and immorality. The Adí-Grant'h,
the whole of the first part of which
is ascribed to Nánac, is written, like the
rest of the books of the Sikhs, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Gúrúmuk'h<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> character. I can only judge
very imperfectly of the value of this work:
but some extracts, translated from it, appear
worthy of that admiration which is
bestowed upon it by the Sikhs.</p>

<p>The Adí-Grant'h is in verse; and many
of the chapters, written by Nánac, are
termed Pídi, which means, literally, a ladder
or flight of steps; and, metaphorically, that
by which a man ascends.</p>

<p>In the following fragment, literally translated
from the Sódar rág ásá mahilla pehla
of Nánac, he displays the supremacy of the
true God, and the inferiority of the Dévatás,
and other created beings, to the universal
Creator; however they may have
been elevated into deities by ignorance or
superstition.</p>

He is the Pádsháh and the Pádsáheb of Sháhs; Nánac resides in his favour.<br />
</div>

<p>These few verses are, perhaps, sufficient
to show, that it was on a principle of pure
deism that Nánac entirely grounded his
religion. It was not possible, however,
that the minds of any large portion of mankind
could remain long fixed in a belief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
which presented them only with general
truths, and those of a nature too vast for
their contemplation or comprehension. The
followers of Nánac, since his death, have
paid an adoration to his name, which is at
variance with the lessons which he taught;
they have clothed him in all the attributes
of a saint: they consider him as the selected
instrument of God to make known
the true faith to fallen man; and, as such,
they give him divine honours; not only
performing pilgrimage to his tomb, but
addressing him, in their prayers, as their
saviour and mediator.</p>

<p>The religious tenets and usages of the
Sikhs continued, as they had been established
by Nánac<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>, till the time of Gúrú<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
Góvind; who, though he did not alter the
fundamental principles of the established
faith, made so complete a change in the
sacred usages and civil habits of his followers,
that he gave them an entirely new
character: and though the Sikhs retain all
their veneration for Nánac, they deem Gúrú
Góvind to have been equally exalted, by
the immediate favour and protection of the
Divinity; and the Dasama Pádsháh ká
Grant'h, or book of the tenth king, which
was written by Gúrú Góvind, is considered,
in every respect, as holy as the Adí-Grant'h
of Nánac, and his immediate successors.
I cannot better explain the pretensions
which Gúrú Góvind has made to the rank
of a prophet, than by exhibiting his own
account of his mission in a literal version
from his Vichitra Nátac.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>"I now declare my own history, and
the multifarious austerities which I have
performed.</p>

<p>"Where the seven peaks rise beautiful
on the mountain Hémacuta, and the
place takes the name of Sapta Sringa,
greater penance have I performed than
was ever endured by Pándu Rájá, meditating
constantly on Mahá Cál and Cálica,
till diversity was changed into one form.
My father and mother meditated on the
Divinity, and performed the Yóga, till
Gúrú Déva approved of their devotions.
Then the Supreme issued his order, and
I was born, in the Cáli Yug, though my
inclination was not to come into the
world, my mind being fixed on the foot
of the Supreme. When the supreme
Being made known his will, I was sent
into the world. The eternal Being thus
addressed this feeble insect:</p>

<p>"&mdash;I have manifested thee as my own
son, and appointed thee to establish a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
perfect Pant'h (sect). Go into the world,
establish virtue and expel vice."&mdash;</p>

<p>"&mdash;I stand with joined hands, bending
my head at thy word: the Pant'h shall
prevail in the world, when thou lendest
thine aid.&mdash;Then was I sent into the
world: thus I received mortal birth. As
the Supreme spoke to me, so do I speak,
and to none do I bear enmity. Whoever
shall call me Paraméswara, he shall sink
into the pit of hell: know, that I am only
the servant of the Supreme, and concerning
this entertain no doubt. As God
spoke, I announce unto the world, and
remain not silent in the world of men.</p>

<p>"As God spoke, so do I declare, and I
regard no person's word. I wear my
dress in nobody's fashion, but follow that
appointed by the Supreme. I perform
no worship to stones, nor imitate the
ceremonies of any one. I pronounce
the infinite name, and have attained to
the supreme Being. I wear no bristling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
locks on my head, nor adorn myself with
ear-rings. I receive no person's words in
my ears; but as the Lord speaks, I act.
I meditate on the sole name, and attain
my object. To no other do I perform
the Jáp, in no other do I confide: I
meditate on the infinite name, and attain
the supreme light. On no other do I
meditate; the name of no other do I
pronounce.</p>

<p>"For this sole reason, to establish virtue,
was I sent into the world by Gúrú Déva.
'Every where,' said he, 'establish virtue,
and exterminate the wicked and vitious.'
For this purpose have I received mortal
birth; and this let all the virtuous understand.
To establish virtue, to exalt piety,
and to extirpate the vitious utterly.
Every former Avatár established his own
Jáp; but no one punished the irreligious,
no one established both the principles
and practice of virtue, (Dherm Carm).
Every holy man (Ghóus), and prophet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
(Ambia), attempted only to establish his
own reputation in the world; but no one
comprehended the supreme Being, or
understood the true principles or practice
of virtue. The doctrine of no other is of
any avail: this doctrine fix in your minds.
There is no benefit in any other doctrine,
this fix in your minds.</p>

<p>"Whoever reads the Korán, whoever
reads the Purán, neither of them shall
escape death, and nothing but virtue
shall avail at last. Millions of men may
read the Korán, they may read innumerable
Puráns; but it shall be of no
avail in the life to come, and the power
of destiny shall prevail over them."</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind, after this account of the
origin of his mission, gives a short account
of his birth and succession to the spiritual
duties at his father's death.</p>

<p>"At the command of God I received
mortal birth, and came into the world.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
This I now declare briefly; attend to
what I speak.</p>

<p>"My father journeyed towards the East,
performing ablution in all the sacred
springs. When he arrived at Triveni,
he spent a day in acts of devotion and
charity. On that occasion was I manifested.
In the town of Patna I received
a body. Then the Madra Dés received
me, and nurses nursed me tenderly, and
tended me with great care, instructing
me attentively every day. When I
reached the age of Dherm and Carm
(principles and practice), my father departed
to the Déva Lóca. When I was
invested with the dignity of Rája, I
established virtue to the utmost of my
power. I addicted myself to every species
of hunting in the forests, and daily
killed the bear and the stag. When I
had become acquainted with that country,
I proceeded to the city of Pávatá,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
where I amused myself on the banks of
the Calindri, and viewed every kind of
spectacle. There I slew a great number
of tigers; and, in various modes, hunted
the bear."</p>

<p>The above passages will convey an idea
of that impression which Gúrú Góvind
gave his followers of his divine mission. I
shall shortly enumerate those alterations he
made in the usages of the Sikhs, whom
it was his object to render, through the
means of religious enthusiasm, a warlike
race.</p>

<p>Though Gúrú Góvind was brought up in
the religion of Nánac, he appears, from
having been educated among the Hindú
priests of Mathura, to have been deeply
tainted with their superstitious belief; and
he was, perhaps, induced by considerations
of policy, to lean still more strongly to their
prejudices, in order to induce them to become
converts to that religious military
community, by means of which it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
his object to destroy the Muhammedan
power.</p>

<p>The principal of the religious institutions
of Gúrú Góvind, is that of the Páhal,&mdash;the
ceremony by which a convert is initiated
into the tribe of Sikhs; or, more properly
speaking, that of Singhs. The meaning of
this institution is to make the convert a
member of the Khálsa, or Sikh commonwealth,
which he can only become by
assenting to certain observances; the devoting
himself to arms for the defence of
the commonwealth, and the destruction of
its enemies; the wearing his hair, and putting
on a blue dress<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>
<p>The mode in which Gúrú Góvind first
initiated his converts, is described by a Sikh
writer; and, as I believe it is nearly the
same as that now observed, I shall shortly
state it as he has described it. Gúrú
Góvind, he says, after his arrival at Mák'haval,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
initiated five converts, and gave
them instructions how to initiate others.
The mode is as follows. The convert is
told that he must allow his hair to grow.
He must clothe himself from head to foot
in blue clothes. He is then presented with
the five weapons: a sword, a firelock, a
bow and arrow, and a pike<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>. One of
those who initiate him then says, "The
Gúrú is thy holy teacher, and thou art
his Sikh or disciple." Some sugar and
water is put into a cup, and stirred round
with a steel knife, or dagger, and some
of the first chapters of the Adí-Grant'h,
and the first chapters of the Dasama Pádsháh
ká Grant'h, are read; and those who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
perform the initiation exclaim, <i>Wá! Gúrúji
ká Khálsa! Wá! Gúrúji kí Fateh!</i> (Success
to the state of the Gúrú! Victory attend
the Gúrú!) After this exclamation has
been repeated five times, they say, "This
sherbet is nectar. It is the water of life;
drink it." The disciple obeys; and some
sherbet, prepared in a similar manner, is
sprinkled over his head and beard. After
these ceremonies, the disciple is asked if he
consents to be of the faith of Gúrú Góvind.
He answers, "I do consent." He is then
told, "If you do, you must abandon all
intercourse, and neither eat, drink, nor sit
in company with men of five sects which
I shall name. The first, the Mína D'hirmal;
who, though of the race of Nánac,
were tempted by avarice to give poison
to Arjun; and, though they did not succeed,
they ought to be expelled from
society. The second are the Musandiá;
a sect who call themselves Gúrús, or
priests, and endeavour to introduce heterodox<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
doctrines<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>. The third, Rám
Ráyí, the descendants of Rám Ráy,
whose intrigues were the great cause of
the destruction of the holy ruler, Tégh
Singh. The fourth are the Kud i-már,
or destroyers<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> of their own daughters.
Fifth, the Bhadaní, who shave the hair
of their head and beards." The disciple,
after this warning against intercourse with
sectaries, or rather schismatics, is instructed
in some general precepts, the observance of
which regard the welfare of the community
into which he has entered. He is told to
be gentle and polite to all with whom he
converses, to endeavour to attain wisdom,
and to emulate the persuasive eloquence of
Bábá Nánac. He is particularly enjoined,
whenever he approaches any of the Sikh
temples, to do it with reverence and respect,
and to go to Amritsar, to pay his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
devotions to the Khálsa, or state; the
interests of which he is directed, on all
occasions, to consider paramount to his
own. He is instructed to labour to increase
the prosperity of the town of Amritsar;
and told, that at every place of
worship which he visits he will be conducted
in the right path by the Gúrú (Gúrú
Góvind). He is instructed to believe, that
it is the duty of all those who belong to the
Khálsa, or commonwealth of the Sikhs,
neither to lament the sacrifice of property,
nor of life, in support of each other; and
he is directed to read the Adí-Grant'h and
Dasama Pádsháh ká Grant'h, every morning
and every evening. Whatever he has
received from God, he is told it is his duty
to share with others. And after the disciple
has heard and understood all these
and similar precepts, he is declared to be
duly initiated.</p>

<p>Gúrú Góvind Singh, agreeably to this
Sikh author, after initiating the first five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
disciples in the mode above stated, ordered
the principal persons among them<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> to
initiate him exactly on similar occasions,
which he did. The author from whom the
above account is taken, states, that when
Góvind was at the point of death, he exclaimed,
"Wherever five Sikhs are assembled,
there I also shall be present!"
and, in consequence of this expression, five
Sikhs are the number necessary to make
a Singh, or convert. By the religious
institutions of Gúrú Góvind, proselytes are
admitted from all tribes and casts in the
universe. The initiation may take place
at any time of life, but the children of the
Singhs all go through this rite at a very early
age.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>
<p>The leading tenet of Gúrú Góvind's religious
institutions, which obliges his followers
to devote themselves to arms, is
stated, in one of the chapters of the Dasama
Pádsháh ká Grant'h, or book of the tenth
king, written in praise of Dúrga B'havání,
the goddess of courage: "Dúrga," Gúrú
Góvind says, "appeared to me when I
was asleep, arrayed in all her glory. The
goddess put into my hand the hilt of
a bright scimitar, which she had before
held in her own. 'The country of the
Muhammedans,' said the goddess, 'shall
be conquered by thee, and numbers of
that race shall be slain.' After I had
heard this, I exclaimed, 'This steel shall
be the guard to me and my followers,
because, in its lustre, the splendour of
thy countenance, O goddess! is always
reflected<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a>.'"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>
<p>The Dasama Pádsháh ká Grant'h of
Gúrú Góvind appears, from the extracts
which I have seen of it, to abound in fine
passages. Its author has borrowed largely
from the Sástras of the Brahméns, and the
Korán. He praises Nánac as a holy saint,
accepted of God; and grounds his faith,
like that of his predecessors, upon the
adoration of one God; whose power and
attributes he however describes by so many
Sanscrit names, and with such constant
allusions to the Hindú mythology, that it
appears often difficult to separate his purer
belief from their gross idolatry. He, however,
rejects all worship of images, on an
opinion taken from one of the ancient
Védas, which declares, "that to worship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
an idol made of wood, earth, or stone, is
as foolish as it is impious; for God alone
is deserving of adoration."</p>

<p>The great points, however, by which
Gúrú Góvind has separated his followers
for ever from the Hindús, are those which
have been before stated;&mdash;the destruction
of the distinction of casts, the admission of
proselytes, and the rendering the pursuit of
arms not only admissible, but the religious
duty of all his followers. Whereas, among
the Hindús, agreeable to the Dherma
Sástra, (one of the most revered of their
sacred writings,) carrying arms on all occasions,
as an occupation, is only lawful to
the Cshatríya or military tribe. A Bráhmen
is allowed to obtain a livelihood by
arms, if he can by no other mode. The
Vaisya and Súdra are not allowed to make
arms their profession, though they may use
them in self-defence.</p>

<p>The sacred book of Gúrú Góvind is not
confined to religious subjects, or tales of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Hindú mythology, related in his own way;
but abounds in accounts of the battles
which he fought, and of the actions which
were performed by the most valiant of his
followers. Courage is, throughout this work,
placed above every other virtue; and Góvind,
like Muhammed, makes martyrdom
for the faith which he taught, the shortest
and most certain road to honour in this
world, and eternal happiness in the future.
The opinion which the Sikhs entertain of
Góvind will be best collected from their
most esteemed authors.</p>

<p>"Gúrú Góvind Singh," one<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> of those
writers states, "appeared as the tenth
Avatár. He meditated on the Creator
himself, invisible, eternal, and incomprehensible.
He established the Khálsa,
his own sect, and, by exhibiting singular
energy, leaving the hair on his head, and
seizing the scimitar, he smote every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
wicked person. He bound the garment
of chastity round his loins, grasped the
sword of valour, and, passing the true
word of victory, became victorious in
the field of combat; and seizing the
Dévatás, his foes, he inflicted on them
punishment; and, with great success, diffused
the sublime Gúrú Jáp (a mystical
form of prayer composed by Gúrú Góvind)
through the world. As he was
born a warlike Singh, he assumed the
blue dress; and, by destroying the wicked
Turks, he exalted the name of Hari
(God). No Sirdar could stand in battle
against him, but all of them fled; and,
whether Hindú Rájás, or Muhammedan
lords, became like dust in his presence.
The mountains, hearing of him, were
struck with terror; the whole world was
affrighted, and the people fled from their
habitations. In short, such was his fame,
that they were all thrown into consternation,
and began to say, 'Besides thee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
O Sat Gúrú! there is no dispeller of
danger,'&mdash;Having seized and displayed
his sword, no person could resist his
might."</p>

<p>The same author, in a subsequent passage,
gives a very characteristic account
of that spirit of hostility which the religion
of Gúrú Góvind breathed against the Muhammedans;
and of the manner in which
it treated those sacred writings, upon which
most of the established usages of Hindús
are grounded.</p>

<p>"By the command of the Eternal, the
great Gúrú disseminated the true knowledge.
Full of strength and courage, he
successfully established the Khálsa (or
state). Thus, at once founding the
sect of Singh, he struck the whole world
with awe: overturning temples and sacred
places, tombs and mosques, he levelled
them all with the plain: rejecting the
Védas, the Puráns, the six Sástras, and
the Korán; he abolished the cry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Namáz (Muhammedan prayer), and slew
the Sultans; reducing the Mírs and Pírs
(the lords and priests of the Muhammedans)
to silence, he overturned all
their sects; the Moullahs (professors), and
the Kázis (judges), were confounded,
and found no benefit from their studies.
The Bráhmens, the Pandits, and the
Jótìshis (or astrologers), had acquired a
relish for worldly things: they worshipped
stones and temples, and forgot the
Supreme. Thus these two sects, the
Muhammedan and Hindú, remained involved
in delusion and ignorance, when
the third sect of the Khálsa originated in
purity. When, at the order of Gúrú
Góvind, the Singhs seized and displayed
the scimitar, then subduing all their
enemies, they meditated on the Eternal;
and, as soon as the order of the Most
High was manifested in the world, circumcision
ceased, and the Turks trembled,
when they saw the ritual of Muhammed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
destroyed: then the Nakára
(large drum) of victory sounded throughout
the world, and fear and dread were
abolished. Thus the third sect was
established, and increased greatly in
might."</p>

<p>These extracts, and what I have before
stated, will sufficiently show the character
of the religious institutions of Gúrú Góvind;
which were admirably calculated to
awaken, through the means of fanaticism,
a spirit of courage and independence,
among men who had been content, for
ages, with that degraded condition in
society, to which they were taught to
believe themselves born. The end which
Góvind sought, could not, perhaps, have
been attained by the employment of other
means. Exhortations respecting their civil
rights, and the wrongs which they sustained,
would have been wasted on minds
enslaved by superstition, and who could
only be persuaded to assert themselves men,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
by an impression that it was the will of
Heaven they should do so. His success
is a strong elucidation of the general character
of the Hindú natives of India. That
race, though in general mild and peaceable,
take the most savage and ferocious turn,
when roused to action by the influence
of religious feeling.</p>

<p>I have mentioned, in the narrative part
of this Sketch, the attempt of the Bairágí
Banda to alter the religious institutions of
Gúrú Góvind, and its failure. The tribe of
Acálís (immortals), who have now assumed
a dictatorial sway in all the religious ceremonies
at Amritsar, and the Nirmala and
Shahid, who read the sacred writings, may
hereafter introduce some changes in those
usages which the Sikhs revere: but it is
probable that the spirit of equality, which
has been hitherto considered as the vital
principle of the Khálsa or commonwealth,
and which makes all Sikhs so reluctant to
own either a temporal or spiritual leader,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
will tend greatly to preserve their institutions
from invasion: and it is stated, in
a tradition which is universally believed
by the Sikhs, and has, indeed, been inserted
in their sacred writings, that Gúrú
Góvind, when he was asked by his followers,
who surrounded his death-bed, to
whom he would leave his authority? replied,
"I have delivered over the Khálsa (commonwealth)
to God, who never dies. I
have been your guide, and will still preserve
you; read the Grant'h, and attend
to its tenets; and whoever remains true
to the state, him will I aid." From these
dying words of Gúrú Góvind, the Sikhs
believe themselves to have been placed, by
their last and most revered prophet, under
the peculiar care of God: and their attachment
to this mysterious principle, leads
them to consider the Khálsa (or commonwealth)
as a theocracy; and such
an impression is likely to oppose a very
serious obstacle, if not an insuperable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
barrier, to the designs of any of their
chiefs, who may hereafter endeavour to
establish an absolute power over the whole
nation.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_96_96" id="Footnote_96_96"></a><a href="#FNanchor_96_96"><span class="label">[96]</span></a> This celebrated Súfi, or philosophical deist, lived
in the time of the Emperor Shér Sháh. He was, by
trade, a weaver; but has written several admired
works. They are all composed in a strain of universal
philanthropy and benevolence; and, above all, he inculcated
religious toleration, particularly between the
Muhammedans and Hindús, by both of whom his
memory is held in the highest esteem and veneration.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_97_97" id="Footnote_97_97"></a><a href="#FNanchor_97_97"><span class="label">[97]</span></a> Nánac was celebrated for the manner in which he
performed Tapasa, or austere devotion, which requires
the mind to be so totally absorbed in the Divinity, as
to be abstracted from every worldly thought, and this
for as long a period as human strength is capable of
sustaining.</p></div>

paid adoration to idols; but, though they adored God,
they worshipped the sun and elements.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> There is no ground to conclude that casts were
altogether abolished by Nánac; though his doctrines
and writings had a tendency to equalize the Hindús,
and unite all in the worship of one God.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_105_105" id="Footnote_105_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> A kind of ascetic devotion, which has been before

to have preserved his attachment to this favourite
dogma of the Hindús.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_109_109" id="Footnote_109_109"></a><a href="#FNanchor_109_109"><span class="label">[109]</span></a> This fact is admitted by Sikh authors. It is, however,
probable, that Nánac was but imperfectly acquainted
with the doctrines of that volume.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> Certainly no material alteration was made, either
in the belief or forms of the Sikhs, by any of his successors
before Gúrú Góvind. Har Góvind, who
armed his followers to repel aggression, would only
appear to have made a temporary effort to oppose his
enemies, without an endeavour to effect any serious
change in the religious belief or customs of the sect to
which he belonged.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_112_112" id="Footnote_112_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> It has been before stated, that all the followers
of Góvind do not now wear the blue dress,
but they all wear their hair; and their jealous regard
of it is not to be described. Three inferior
agents of Sikh chiefs were one day in my tent;
one of them was a Khálsa Singh, and the two
others of the Khalása tribe of Sikhs. I was laughing
and joking with the Khálsa Singh, who said
he had been ordered to attend me to Calcutta. Among
other subjects of our mirth, I rallied him on trusting
himself so much in my power. "Why, what is the
worst," said he, "that you can do to me, when
I am at such a distance from home?" I passed my
hand across my chin, imitating the act of shaving.
The man's face was in an instant distorted with rage,
and his sword half drawn. "You are ignorant," said
he to me, "of the offence you have given. I cannot
strike you, who are above me, and the friend of my
master and the state. But no power," he added,
"shall save these fellows," alluding to the two Khalása
Sikhs, "from my revenge, for having dared to
smile at your action." It was with the greatest
difficulty, and only by the good offices of some Sikh
chiefs, that I was able to pacify the wounded honour
of this Singh.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_113_113" id="Footnote_113_113"></a><a href="#FNanchor_113_113"><span class="label">[113]</span></a> The goddess of courage, Bhavání Durgá, represented
in the Dasama Pádsháh ká Grant'h, or book of
kings of Gúrú Góvind, as the soul of arms, or tutelary
goddess of war, and is thus addressed: "Thou art the
edge of the sword, thou art the arrow, the sword,
the knife, and the dagger."</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_114_114" id="Footnote_114_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> Gúrú Góvind put to death many of this tribe.</p></div>

on Friday, the 8th of the month B'hádra, in the
year 1753 of the æra of Vicramáditya; and on that
day his great work, the Dasama Pádsháh ká Grant'h,
or book of the tenth king, was completed.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_117_117" id="Footnote_117_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> An author, whom I have often quoted, says,
Gúrú Góvind gave the following injunctions to his
followers: "It is right to slay a Muhammedan wherever
you meet him. If you meet a Hindú, beat
him and plunder him, and divide his property
among you. Employ your constant effort to destroy
the countries ruled by Muhammedans. If they
oppose you, defeat and slay them."</p></div>

clear and concise enough to become a Manual for the young Sailor,
which he may carry about with him till he has treasured up the
example in his memory and in his heart. In attempting such a Work,
the Author proposes to himself to write the Eulogy of our great Naval
Hero; for the best Eulogy of <span class="smcap">Nelson</span> is the faithful history of his
actions; the best history is that which shall relate them most perspicuously.</p>

different periods: interspersed with passages of exquisite Poetry.</p>


<p>17. CALAMITIES OF AUTHORS: Including some Inquiries

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
